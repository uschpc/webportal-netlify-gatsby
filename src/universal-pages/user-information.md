The Center for Advanced Research Computing offers a wide variety of user support resources and documentation about our computing systems, how to access them, and how to use them.

Below are the pages and categories in the User Information section of this website.

### [Getting started at the CARC](/user-information/getting-started)

An introduction to the CARC, high-performance computing, and clusters, and information on how to get started with our computing systems. Think of this as a crash-course in everything CARC.

### [CARC accounts, accessing our systems, and resource allocations](/user-information/accounts)

Information on CARC accounts and how you can access our systems, as well as details on the different file systems each account has access to.

### [System information: computing cluster information, file systems, and CARC operating system](/user-information/system-information)

Technical specs for the CARC's HPC clusters and file systems.

### [User guides](/user-information/user-guides)

Our most comprehensive user support resource. Our user guides cover everything you'll need to know to use our systems.

Our guides are organized into the following categories:

* High-performance computing (both Discovery and Endeavour clusters)
* Data management and transfers
* Software and programming
* Project and allocation management in the user portal
* Hybrid cloud computing 
* Secure computing

### [Project and resource allocation management via the Research Computing User Portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal)

A landing page for the Research Computing User Portal, where you can manage your projects and computing/storage resources. This page includes links to the user portal and to its user guides.

### [Online user discussion forum](https://hpc-discourse.usc.edu/)

An online community for discussion and knowledge sharing among users. The user forum is a great resource for discussing CARC-related topics, asking non-urgent technical questions, and sharing ideas. The CARC team monitors the forum for questions, but users are also encouraged to interact with each other.

### [Information on the Condo Cluster Program (CCP)](/user-information/ccp)

The CARC's Condo Cluster Program is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves.

### [Frequently asked questions about the CARC and our systems](/user-information/frequently-asked-questions)

An extensive list of answers to your common questions.

### [User Support](/user-support)

A hub for our user support resources. This is where you'll find links to our ticket submission form, IT Services support, and other support resources listed above.
