Announced in August 2020, the Center for Advanced Research Computing's new website is a major upgrade to USC's Research Computing program. In addition to its updated design, the website also includes numerous new features not seen on our previous website.

[Home Page Resources](https://carc.usc.edu/)

[](https://carc.usc.edu/)On our home page, you'll find a dashboard-style view of announcements, news stories, Tweets, helpful links, the current CARC system status, and a preview of the latest posts in our Discourse community. Check back frequently to see important announcements, exciting news stories and interviews, and to stay up-to-date on our Twitter and Discourse feeds!

[News and Announcements](https://carc.usc.edu/news-and-events/news-and-announcements)

Our news stories include CARC-specific content, including alerts about system maintenance and announcements of new or upgraded services, as well as community interest stories about research being done with CARC resources. In the coming months, we plan to feature interviews with some of our current researchers. Stay tuned!

[User Support](https://carc.usc.edu/user-support)

Our User Support page is a first-point-of-contact for any and all problems or questions you might have.

Here, you'll find links to our User Guides and Frequently Asked Questions pages to provide solutions for common questions or issues. This is also where you'll access our Ticket Submission page if you require help from a CARC staff member.

We've also provided links to our User Portal, where Principal Investigators (PIs) can manage their projects and resource allocations, and to our Discourse User Forum, which is a discussion community for CARC users (described below).

If you're experiencing issues with your USC NetID (which you use to log in to CARC systems) or Duo two-factor authentication, we've also provided a link to USC's IT Services help pages.

[Discourse User Forum](https://hpc-discourse.usc.edu/categories)

The Discourse discussion platform is a question-and-answer community for CARC users to ask questions, discuss research computing, and share their experiences with CARC systems and resources. It's a great place to seek out collaborative help from other users. CARC staff also post about troubleshooting and solutions to any common or unique issues our users have experienced.
