On March 23, 2020, The White House launched the **COVID-19 High Performance Computing Consortium**, a new program that offers COVID-19 researchers access to high performance computing systems. The use of these systems aims to greatly expedite the timelines for calculations and modeling required for the research of the virus.

Created by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the US Department of Energy, and IBM, this partnership brings together the public and private sectors to provide resources for research into COVID-19. Consortium members include leaders in industry and academia, as well as federal agencies and the US Department of Energy National Laboratories, all of which have donated free compute time and resources on their high performance computing systems.

Details about the consortium and statements from its members can be found here: <https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/white-house-announces-new-partnership-unleash-u-s-supercomputing-resources-fight-covid-19/>

The consortium is currently accepting research proposals related to COVID-19 on its online portal. Information on the consortiumâ€™s computing resources and instructions for submitting proposals can be found here: <https://covid19-hpc-consortium.org/>

USC Research Computing is committed to supporting USC researchers in the effort of fighting COVID-19. We are offering our resources for research related to the virus, and we welcome any possible partnerships for proposal submission to the consortium. Researchers in bioinformatics, epidemiology, molecular modeling, and any other relevant areas are invited to contact us at carc-support@usc.edu to find out more about the program.
