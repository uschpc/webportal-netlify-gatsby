With our new project file system comes a change to our storage allocation quota and policy.

Storage allocations are measured using disk space in terabytes (equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes).

All users of active projects automatically receive a storage allocation on the CARC project file system. The default allocation size is 1 TB per PI, which can be increased up to 5 TB per PI, if needed, at no extra cost. **Unlike compute allocations, the 5 TB storage limit is per PI, rather than per project**. If a PI has multiple projects, the maximum allocation of 5 TB can be divided among the projects.

If more than 5 TB is needed, a PI can request additional storage space through the [Research Computing User Portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/). The additional storage space in excess of the first 5 TB is a paid service. The current price is $40/TB/year.

For example, when a PI requires 10 TB of space, the annual charge for the data storage space will be:

> 10 TB/year = 5 TB free + (5 x $40/TB/year = $200/year)

For more information on allocations, see our [Accounts and Allocations page](https://carc.usc.edu/user-information/accounts).
