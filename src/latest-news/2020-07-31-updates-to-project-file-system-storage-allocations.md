With our new project file system comes a change to our storage allocation quota and policy.

Storage allocations are measured using disk space in terabytes (equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes).  

All active projects automatically receive a storage allocation on the CARC project file system. The default minimum allocation size is 5 TB per project, and each PI receives a maximum allocation of 10 TB for their project(s) at no cost. All users for a project will have access to that project's allocation.

If more than 10 TB is needed, a PI can request additional storage space through the [Research Computing User Portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/). The additional storage space in excess of the first 10 TB is a paid service. Additional storage space can be added in increments of 5 TB, and the current price is $200/5 TB/year. For example, when a PI requires 20 TB total of space, the annual cost for the data storage space will be:

>20 TB per year = 10 TB free + (2 x $200/5 TB/year) = $400 annual cost

For more information on allocations, see our [Accounts and Allocations page](https://carc.usc.edu/user-information/accounts).
