On September 18, our systems will undergo full-day maintenance, which will include improving Discovery’s interconnection network performance and installing our new project file system. System downtime will begin at 8:00 am and is projected to finish by the evening.

During this time, all CARC systems, including the Discovery cluster, condo nodes, and our file systems, will be unavailable. Your data in our file systems will not be accessible during this time, but it will **not** be erased. The Slurm job scheduler will not be accepting jobs to run during the maintenance period. Once the maintenance is completed, we will send out an announcement.

After the maintenance, we will be working with you to complete the data migration process from our current project file system to the new one. You will receive an email from us with instructions on how to migrate your data. Please look out for this email so you can begin your data migration process as soon as possible.

As always, please make sure that you have backed up any important data.

Moving forward, we plan to have regular system maintenance scheduled for the third Friday of each month; September 18 will be the first occurrence of this regular maintenance.
