With the launch of its new high-performance computing cluster, USC’s Center for High-Performance Computing (HPC) has also officially changed its name to the Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC).

This new name signifies the research support-focused direction the CARC is heading in. In addition to the new cluster and other system upgrades, the CARC will be expanding their services to include an updated, subscription-based condo node program, as well as a data archiving service. A new website, project resource user portal, and user education program will also be developed to support the research of USC’s faculty and students.
