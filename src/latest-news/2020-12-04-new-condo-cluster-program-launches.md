The CARC is pleased to announce its new [Condo Cluster Program (CCP)](/user-information/ccp/program-information), offering greater flexibility for researchers who prefer to have access to their own dedicated compute nodes.

Prior to the development of the new CCP, users could purchase their condo nodes using a traditional purchase model, which typically specified a five-year service term for the chosen nodes, after which the nodes would be retired. In this pricing model, the CARC would purchase and maintain the nodes for the duration of the term. This pricing model remains, but the CCP also includes an annual subscription pricing model. Users can subscribe to their desired nodes on an annual basis, choosing either to renew, modify, or terminate their subscription each year. This model is recommended for researchers that anticipate changes to their condo needs or who donâ€™t need a long-term condo solution. 

Nodes subscribed to or purchased through the CCP form the [Endeavour condo cluster](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-endeavour), which is a new high-performance computing cluster designated especially for the CCP. CCP users will enjoy the same advanced computing capabilities, fast speeds, and software stack that the Discovery cluster offers.
