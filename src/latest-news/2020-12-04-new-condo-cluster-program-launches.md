The CARC is pleased to announce its new [Condo Cluster Program (CCP)](/user-information/ccp/program-information), offering greater flexibility for researchers who prefer to have access to their own dedicated compute nodes.

Prior to the development of the new CCP, PIs could purchase dedicated compute nodes using a traditional purchase model, which specified a five-year service term for the chosen nodes, after which the nodes would be retired. This pricing model remains, but the CCP also now includes an annual subscription pricing model. PIs can subscribe to their desired nodes on an annual basis, choosing either to renew, modify, or terminate their subscription each year. In both models, PIs have access to nodes that are completely dedicated for their own jobs, without the job limits and resource restrictions that the nodes in the general-use Discovery cluster have.

Purchases and subscriptions can now be requested and managed in the [CARC user portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal), much like Discovery and storage allocations. Subscriptions are requested in the same way as Discovery and storage allocations (see the [Request New Allocation user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-allocation) for instructions). Purchases are requested via a new purchase form on the [Condo Purchase Requests page](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/purchase/), under the “Project” tab (see the [Request New Condo Purchase user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-purchase) for instructions).

Nodes subscribed to or purchased through the CCP form the [Endeavour condo cluster](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-endeavour), which is a new high-performance computing cluster designated especially for the CCP. CCP users will enjoy the same advanced computing capabilities, fast speeds, and software stack that the Discovery cluster offers.
