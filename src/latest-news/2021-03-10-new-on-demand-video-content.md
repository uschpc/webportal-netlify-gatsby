The CARC is excited to announce a new way to learn. Our new [On-Demand Video Learning page](/education-and-outreach/video-learning) includes content designed to teach users about different technologies and demonstrate common CARC tasks. This online video content is available on-demand to facilitate accessible virtual learning.

Currently, we have four of our weekly workshop recordings available on our new On-Demand Video Learning page. Soon, we'll post more video clips detailing how to log in to our clusters, run jobs, and manage your data.

All videos can also be found on the CARC YouTube channel - make sure to subscribe to stay notified of new uploads!
