At the end of each year, USC departments cease operations for a holiday recess period. This year, the CARC will be closed for the holidays beginning **Friday, December 25, 2020, reopening on Monday, January 4, 2021**. Non-emergency work will be paused until the new year. In the case of an emergency, tickets can still be submitted via our [ticket submission form](/user-information/ticket-submission).

During this recess, large-scale network maintenance in the ITS data center will be taking place. The maintenance will commence on December 28 and should conclude by the morning of January 1. **All CARC systems, including Discovery, Endeavour, and the file systems, will be down during this maintenance period**. Please plan accordingly so your research work is not impacted. Despite the holiday recess, we will inform you of any delays or changes to this timeline.

From everyone at the Center for Advanced Research Computing, we hope you have a safe and warm holiday season. We look forward to continuing to support your research in 2021!
