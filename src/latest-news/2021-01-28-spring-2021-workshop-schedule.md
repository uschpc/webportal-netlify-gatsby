The Center for Advanced Research Computing is excited to announce its Spring 2021 workshop schedule!

This semester, we're focusing on new topics that are of the most interest and use for our users. Thank you to those users who participated in our workshop survey a few weeks ago. The feedback we received was very helpful for choosing workshop formats, times, and topics. We plan to send out another survey at the end of the semester to get your feedback on the Spring 2021 workshops.

We'll be offering workshops virtually **every Friday from 1-3 pm PST**, with the exception of the third Friday of each month, which is typically reserved for system maintenance.

### Weekly workshop schedule

#### Introduction to CARC Systems: Friday, February 5, 2021

An overview of the CARC's high-performance computing clusters. This workshop covers how to log in, manage and transfer data, load and build software, and run and monitor jobs.

#### Introduction to R: Friday, February 12, 2021

An introduction to the R programming environment and language for statistical computing and graphics. This workshop covers basic R concepts and functions for importing, exporting, processing, summarizing, visualizing, and modeling data. It also covers how to install packages and develop scripts and discusses best practices for R programming.

#### Software Management on CARC Systems: Friday, February 26, 2021

This workshop introduces users to the CARC's software stack, which uses Lmod, a Lua-based module system. Users will learn how to manage their environment, find software, load modules, and build their own domain-specific packages.

#### HPC with R: Friday, March 5, 2021

Intermediate-to-advanced topics in R programming using the CARC's high-performance computing clusters, including data I/O, memory usage, parallel programming, debugging, and profiling.

#### Slurm Job Management: Friday, March 12, 2021

This workshop covers how to run and monitor jobs using the Slurm workload manager and job scheduler, including topics like requesting resources, evaluating resource use, running MPI jobs and job arrays, and setting up job dependencies.

#### HPC with Python: Friday, March 26, 2021

Intermediate-to-advanced topics for getting improved Python performance in an HPC cluster environment. Covers debugging, profiling, and parallel programming.

#### Data Management on CARC Systems: Friday, April 2, 2021

This workshop covers various topics in data management and transfer on CARC systems, including transfer tools, file permissions, file I/O, and backups.

#### Software Containers with Singularity: Friday, April 9, 2021

An overview of software containers and how to use Singularity to create and run containers for research and high-performance computing tasks. Singularity containers enable portable and reproducible computing environments and workflows. Build a container with a desired software environment and you can run it on personal or workstation computers, on the CARC's high-performance computing clusters, and in the cloud.

#### Methods for Automating Job Submission: Friday, April 23, 2021

CARC users may find themselves doing repetitive tasks like manually launching jobs, checking their job status, and deciding what kind of jobs to submit based on the results. This workshop covers methods for automating these tasks with tools like job arrays and workflow managment software.

### Semester-long workshops

In addition to our weekly workshops, we're offering two semester-long workshops: **CP2K: Running Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations** and the **Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) series**. These practical, hands-on sessions build on the skills learned each week, but users can still drop in at any point during the semester to see what's being taught. Full descriptions of these workshops can be found on our [Seminars and Workshops page](/education-and-outreach/seminars-and-workshops), and registration details are on our [Events page](/news-and-events/events).
