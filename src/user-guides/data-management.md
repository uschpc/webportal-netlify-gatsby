Data management on CARC systems involves managing, sharing, and transferring files. All research projects should have a data management plan to maximize research productivity on CARC systems.

#### File systems

For detailed information on the available file systems, see the [Storage File Systems user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/storage-file-systems).

#### Managing and sharing files

File management involves organizing, sharing, backing up, and archiving files. On CARC systems, this can be achieved using various command-line tools.

For more information, see the [Managing Files using the Command Line user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/managing-files).

#### Transferring files

Secure and efficient data transfer to and from CARC systems can be achieved with a variety of useful tools, the choice of which depends on whether the storage location is a personal computer or an external site (e.g., cloud storage). The choice also depends heavily on the requirement of data sensitivity as well as the familiarity of the user. There are three methods of data transfer that we recommend for use with CARC systems: **command-line tools**, **graphical tools**, and the **Globus service**.

For more information, see the [File Transfer Overview user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/transfer-overview).
