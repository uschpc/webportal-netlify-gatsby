High-performance computing (HPC) aggregates the resources from individual computers (known as nodes) into a cluster that works together to perform advanced, specialized computing jobs. The Center for Advanced Research Computing launched its new general-purpose high-performance computing cluster, **Discovery**, in August 2020, and its new condo cluster, **Endeavour**, in November 2020.

The following user guides are designed to help you get started with your work on Discovery and/or Endeavour.
