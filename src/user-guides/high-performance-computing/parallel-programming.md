Parallel programming is a type of programming wherein different computing processes are run at the same time, rather than one at a time. Parallel programming is useful for large-scale computation, as large tasks can be broken down into smaller processes and solved in parallel. This divide-and-conquer strategy greatly reduces the computation time required to solve a task.
