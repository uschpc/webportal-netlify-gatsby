The [Condo Cluster Program (CCP)](/user-information/ccp/program-information) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes on an HPC cluster system (the CARC's Endeavour cluster), without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves.

The CCP has two pricing models: an annual subscription-based model and a traditional, five-year term condo purchase model. Subscriptions to resources can be requested in the same way that an allocation on Discovery is requested; see the [Request New Allocation user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-allocation) for instructions on this. Condo purchases are a bit more in-depth, but can still be requested in the User Portal.

### Condo purchase request period

A condo purchase request is possible during the CARC's annual condo purchase request period, which occurs during the fall semester. The whole process of purchase request, system configuration, vendor selection, purchasing, system installation, and deployment typically takes six months. The purchased resources will be in service for 5 years, and after this service period, the CARC will decommission these condo nodes. 

### Requesting a condo purchase

In the User Portal, navigate to the "Project" tab in the top dropdown menu. From the dropdown, select "Condo Purchase Requests":

On the Condo Purchase Requests page, you will see information on the CCP's condo purchase pricing model, including the deadline for purchase requests. You will also see any existing condo purchase requests you have made:
