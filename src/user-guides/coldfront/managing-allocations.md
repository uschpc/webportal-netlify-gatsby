[Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)

An allocation provides you access to a resource and, possibly, limitations for that access.  All USC resources (clusters, servers, storage, cloud, licenses, etc) require an allocation.  All allocations expire at some point, either on a date or when the limit is reached.  For example, an allocation to a cloud resource has a limit of the total number of core hours allowed by that user.  Once the user has reached that number, the allocation expires.  


When users [login to ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/), they will see a list of all the allocations they have access to and the expiration date of that allocation.  In order to renew an allocation, the faculty member who manages the project that the allocation falls under, must take action.


### To renew an allocation for the Discovery cluster:

Allocations for the academic (USC-HPC) cluster expire yearly.  Faculty must renew their allocation or access to the resource will be blocked for all group members.  USC requires faculty to review and update their project(s) annually.  If your project has not be reviewed in a year and an allocation on the project is expiring, you will be forced to go through the project review before renewing the allocation.  More details on the project review can be [found here](yearly-project-renewal).   For instructions on how to renew a cluster allocation, [see this knowledgebase article](renew-allocation)


### To renew an allocation for storage:

USC provides each faculty group with up to 1TB of storage for free.   This is included in the ub-hpc cluster allocation and not listed separately in ColdFront.  If you purchase additional storage, your allocation expires when the warranty on the storage expires.  Before this date, USC will purchase a new storage solution and you will have an opportunity to purchase storage on that system.  If you decide not to do that, you will need to remove your data off the USC network before the old system is retired.  We will provide PLENTY of notice before this occurs.  At this time, all storage allocations expire in December 2020.


### To renew an allocation for a departmental server or cluster:

The allocations for departmental research servers or clusters are set to expire when their warranties expire.  Please discuss with USC prior to the expiration of these warranties.  Once a warranty expires, USC can not fix or replace bad equipment so it is imperative we discuss upgrades or replacements before the warranty on your equipment expires.  The current policy is to power off anything that is more than 7 years old.
