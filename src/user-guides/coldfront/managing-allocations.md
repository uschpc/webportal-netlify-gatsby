An allocation gives you access to a resource and, possibly, limitations for that access.  All ARC resources (clusters, servers, storage, cloud, licenses, etc) require an allocation.  All allocations expire at some point, either on a date or when a limit is reached. For example, an allocation to a cloud resource has a limit of the total number of core hours allowed by that user. Once the user has reached that number, the allocation expires.  

When users [log in to the user portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/), they will see a list of all the allocations they have access to and the expiration date for that allocation.  In order to renew an allocation, the PI who manages the project that the allocation falls under must take action.

### Renewing an allocation for the Discovery cluster

Allocations for the academic (USC-HPC) cluster expire yearly.  Faculty must renew their allocation each year or access to the resource will be blocked for all group members.  ARC requires faculty to review and update their project(s) annually.  If your project has not been reviewed in a year and an allocation for the project is expiring, you will be forced to complete the project review before renewing the allocation.  More details on the project review can be [found here](yearly-project-renewal).   For instructions on how to renew a cluster allocation, see our [Renewing Allocations](renew-allocation) page.


### Renewing an allocation for storage

ARC provides each research group with up to 1TB of storage for free.   This is included in the ub-hpc cluster allocation and not listed separately in the user portal.  If you purchase additional storage, your allocation expires when the warranty on the storage expires.  Before this date, ARC will purchase a new storage solution and you will have an opportunity to purchase storage on that system.  If you decide not to do that, you will need to remove your data off the ARC network before the old system is retired.  We will provide plenty of notice before this occurs.

At this time, all ARC torage allocations expire in December 2020.

### Renewing an allocation for a departmental server or cluster

The allocations for departmental research servers or clusters are set to expire when their warranties expire.  Please discuss with ARC prior to the expiration of these warranties.  Once a warranty expires, USC can not fix or replace broken or problematic equipment, so it is imperative we discuss upgrades or replacements before the warranty on your equipment expires.

ARC's current policy is to retire anything that is more than 7 years old.
