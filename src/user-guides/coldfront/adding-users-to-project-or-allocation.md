&nbsp;  
[Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/) 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Add Users to Project
Click on the project that you want to add a user to, then click the Add User button.

In your project description view, when you click Add Users, you will be sent to a page that allows you to search HPC's system by username.  If found, the user information will be displayed and you can select the account you'd like to add.  The USC username is the first part of the user's USC email address (i.e. in the example user@buffalo.edu the username would be 'user').  If you do not know the username, you can look it up on [USC Online directory](https://uscdirectory.usc.edu/)

You may enter a list of USC usernames in the box.  Please put each username on a separate line or separate usernames by a space


**NOTE: To add a user to your project they must be an active USC member.**  If you have an external-USC collaborator that you want to grant an account to, you must submit a Service Now request for an [iVIP account](https://itservices.usc.edu/iam/ivip/) as only USC Identity and Access Management group can create those accounts.
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
### Search & Add Users
If found in HPC's system, the full names and email addresses of the users will be displayed.  Select the checkbox next to the user(s) you'd like to add.  

Then make sure the allocations you want the user to have access to are selected.  Selecting an allocation tells the system which resource (cluster, server, web portal, software license, etc) to give the user access to.  **If you do NOT select an allocation, the user will not be able to login to any HPC resources except ColdFront and the identity management portal:**

At this point, you have the option of selecting a role for the user - you can add the user as a manager to your project (see this knowledgebase article for more info).  You can return to the Project Overview page and modify any users' roles if you'd like to make them a manager at a later time.

### Project Overview & User List
Click the "Add Selected Users to Project" button when done.  You will see these users have been added to your project now:

### Allocation Detail
You can see all users that have access to your project in the Project Description View.  You can also view this on each of your allocation by clicking the folder icon next to the allocation name:

**Please be aware, you will see the user's status listed as 'active;' however, HPC staff need to modify a new account to give it the access requested.  This is usually done within 1 business day of adding the account in ColdFront.**

NOTE: Users must be in your project to be added to an allocation.  However, all project users do not need to be on every allocation.  If you'd like to add a user from your project onto an allocation they don't currently have access to, go to the Allocation Detail page and click the Add Users button.  Any users in your project that do not already have access to this allocation will be listed and available to be added.
