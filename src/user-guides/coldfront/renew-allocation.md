All allocations expire at some point, either on a date or when a limit is reached. For example, an allocation to a cloud resource has a limit of the total number of core hours allowed by that user. Once the user has reached that number, the allocation expires. In order to renew an allocation, the PI who manages the project that the allocation falls under must take action.

### How to renew allocations

If you have already completed your [project renewal](yearly-project-renewal), you can renew your allocation by clicking on the "expires in X days" label next to the allocation, either on the user portal home page or on the Project Detail page for the project the allocation is associated with:

This will bring you to the Allocation Detail page, where you can click on the "expires in X days" label.  This will show you a list of all users on the allocation and you can choose whether to keep them active, remove them from only the allocation, or remove them from your project altogether:

Click the "Submit" button and your request for renewal will be sent to CARC staff.  You'll see the status change to "Renewal Requested":

Once the renewal is approved by CARC staff, the status will change to "Active" and the End Date will be one year from date of activation.

### Policies for the Discovery cluster

Allocations for the Discovery cluster expire yearly.  Faculty must renew their allocation each year or access to the resource will be blocked for all group members. The CARC requires faculty to review and update their project(s) annually. If your project has not been reviewed in a year and an allocation for the project is expiring, you will be forced to complete the project review before renewing the allocation.  More details on the project review can be [found here](yearly-project-renewal).

### Policies for storage

The CARC provides each research group with up to 10 TB of storage for free, and 5 TB is the default allocation per project. This is included in the USC-HPC cluster allocation and not listed separately in the user portal.

If you purchase additional storage, your allocation expires when the warranty on the storage expires. Before this date, the CARC will purchase a new storage solution and you will have an opportunity to purchase storage on that system. If you decide not to do that, you will need to remove your data off the CARC's network before the old system is retired.  We will provide plenty of notice before this occurs.

At this time, all CARC storage allocations expire in December 2020.

### Policies for a departmental server or cluster

The allocations for departmental research servers or clusters are set to expire when their warranties expire.  Please discuss renewal with the CARC prior to the expiration of these warranties. Once a warranty expires, the CARC cannot fix or replace broken or problematic equipment, so it is imperative to discuss upgrades or replacements before the warranty on your equipment expires.

The CARC's current policy is to retire anything that is more than 7 years old.

### What happens if the allocation expires?

If a PI does not renew cluster allocations by the due date, all users in the group will be blocked from running jobs on the cluster that allocation is linked to. If you have an extenuating circumstance making it impossible to renew on time, please contact the CARC to request an extension.
