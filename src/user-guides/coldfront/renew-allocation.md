excerpt: ColdFront user portal - renewing project allocations
---

Each type of resource offered by the CARC has a different expiration policy.

For example:
* Allocations to the Discovery cluster expire annually
* Allocations to private condo clusters expire every 5 years (or when the hardware warranty expires)
* Allocations to cloud computing resources expire when the compute time is used up

PIs and any users they authorize as "managers" on their projects are the only people that can renew an allocation.  

### Allocation policies

Renewals can be done beginning 60 days before the allocation expires to provide you with plenty of time to complete the process. For cluster allocations, users will receive email reminders that their cluster allocation is expiring at 30 days, 2 weeks, and 1 week before the date of expiration. PIs can click on the link in the email to go directly to the renewal page in the user portal, or they can click on the yellow button displaying "expires in X days" on the user portal's Project Detail page.

### Yearly project renewal

Though faculty are not required to review their project with every allocation that requires renewal, they will not be allowed to renew an allocation unless the project has been reviewed at least once in the previous 365 days.

If you try to renew an allocation without having completed a current project renewal, you will receive this error:

For more details about the yearly project renewal, please see the [Yearly Project Renewal](yearly-project-renewal) user guide.

### Allocation renewal

If you have already completed your project renewal, you can renew your allocation by clicking on the "expires in X days" label next to the allocation, either on the user portal home page or on the Project Detail page for the project the allocation is associated with.

This will bring you to the Allocation Detail page, where you can click on the "expires in X days" label.  This will show you a list of all users on the allocation and you can choose whether to keep them active, remove them from only the allocation, or remove them from your project altogether:

Click the "Submit" button and your request for renewal will be sent to CARC staff.  You'll see the status change to "Renewal Requested":

Once the renewal is approved by CARC staff, the status will change to "Active" and the End Date will be one year from date of activation.

### What happens if the allocation expires?

If a PI does not renew cluster allocations by the due date, all users in the group will be blocked from running jobs on the cluster that allocation is linked to. If you have an extenuating circumstance making it impossible to renew on time, please contact the CARC to request an extension.

### Renewing the allocation for a priority boost

Users and PIs will get notification emails when the priority boost allocation is set to expire.  You **cannot** renew these yourself.
