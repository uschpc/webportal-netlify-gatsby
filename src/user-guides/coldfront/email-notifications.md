Coldfront users are automatically subscribed to receive notifications regarding their project(s) and allocation(s).  These email notifications include things like:
- allocations that are expiring soon (notifications are sent 60 and 30 days before expiration and then once a week until expiration)
- allocations that have expired
- new allocation requests that have been submitted
- allocations that have been renewed and are pending approval

Users can turn off these notifications, if desired.  To do so, login to ColdFront and click on your project to view all the details of the project.  Uncheck the check box by your name under the "Enable Notifications" column:

*NOTE:* it is required that group owners (PIs) and any managers on the project receive the notifications.
