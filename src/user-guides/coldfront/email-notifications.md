CARC users are automatically subscribed to receive notifications from the user portal regarding the project(s) and allocation(s) they belong to.  These email notifications include things like:

- Allocations that are expiring soon. Notifications are sent 60 and 30 days before expiration and then once a week until expiration.
- Allocations that have expired.
- New allocation requests that have been submitted.
- Allocations that have been renewed and are pending approval.

Users can turn off these notifications, if desired.  To do so, log in to the user portal and click on your project to view its details.  Uncheck the check box beside your name under the "Enable Notifications" column:
