Faculty are required to update their project information yearly in order to maintain active accounts at ARC.  This is a short but extremely important process.

Once a year, we ask that you:
* Update your project description and field of science, if necessary.
* Add new publications you may have.
* Add or update grant information.
* Verify the active users on your project and remove any that no longer work with you .

You can do all of this from your project's Project Detail page.

### Is it time to renew?

If your project requires its yearly review, you will see a "Need Review" alert beside your project's name on the user portal home page:

The Project Detail page will also include an alert about the project review at the top of the page:

You can access the Review Project page by clicking either of these alerts.

### Submitting your review

The Review Project page provides a PI with a summary of the project, including the last time publications and grants were updated and a list of current active users on the project. If this information is still accurate and current, simply click the check box verifying the information and click Submit.

If you have NOT updated your publications or grant information in the last year, a text box will appear on the Review Project page requiring you to enter a statement explaining this. We understand faculty may not have this data to provide and this will not prevent your account from being renewed.  However, we do require an explanation:

Once the project review is complete, you will see a green notification banner with "Project reviewed successfully" at the top of the page and a "project review pending" label in the Project Detail page.

### Review approval

The project review is is submitted for review by the ARC director. If all is in order, they will approve the renewal and you will once again be able to renew and request new allocations. The 'project review pending' label will then disappear.
