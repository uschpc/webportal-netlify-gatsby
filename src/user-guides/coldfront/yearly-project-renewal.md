[Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Faculty are required to update their project information yearly, in order to main active accounts at HPC.  This is a short but extremely important process.  We ask that you:
* Update your project description and field of science, if necessary.
* Add new publications you may have
* Add or update grant information
* Verify the active users on your project and remove any that no longer work with you  
**You can do all of this from your Project Detail page (click on the name of your project from the home page)**

### Projects
Once this is complete, you can click on the "Needs Review" link on the home page or on the Review Project link from the Project Detail page:

&nbsp;
### Projects
If you click on the project name, you're taken to the Project Detail page.  Here you you will see a notification about the project review as well:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The Review Project page provides faculty with a summary of the project info including the last time publications and grants were updated and a list of current active users on the project.  If this information is correct, click the check box verifying the information and click the Submit button.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Please note that if you have NOT updated your publications or grant information in the last year, a text box will appear on the Review Project page requiring you to enter a statement explaining this.  We understand faculty may not have this data to provide and this will not prevent your account from being renewed.  However, we do require an explanation:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Once the project review is complete, it is submitted for review by the HPC director.  You will see a green notification banner with "Project reviewed successfully" at the top of the page and the 'project review pending' label in the Project Detail page.  If all is in order, he will approve the renewal and you will once again be able to renew and request new allocations.  The 'project review pending' label will then disappear.
