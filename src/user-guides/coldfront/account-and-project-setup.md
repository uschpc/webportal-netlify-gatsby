All active USC members have access to CARC resources and the user portal, but only faculty and staff members can act as Principal Investigators (PIs). In the user portal, PIs can create projects, request resource allocations for their projects, and add other users (including students) to the projects they control.

Even though a PI can log in to the user portal, they won't have access to CARC resources by default. In order to start using CARC resources, PIs must create a project and request a resource allocation for it. Adding users to a project is optional.

The following is an overview of the steps required to start using CARC resources. For more detailed instructions, see each individual user guide linked below.  

**STEP 1**: To begin, [Log in to the user portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/). Once logged in, PIs should see a button to "+Add a Project" on the left hand side of the screen.

**STEP 2**:  Before you will be able to run jobs or get access to any of the CARC's resources, you will need to create a project:  

[Create New Project](create-a-new-project)  

**STEP 3**:  Next, you will need to request an allocation to at least one resource (cluster, storage, cloud, etc.).  Most projects should request an allocation of the Discovery cluster:

[Request New Allocation](request-new-allocation)

If you require access to more than one resource, you can request multiple allocations. Allocation requests can take a day or longer to be approved by the CARC team.

**STEP 4 (optional)**: You can also add users to your project/allocation that will get access to the resources you grant them access to:  

[Adding Users](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)  

There is a delay of at least one hour before newly-added user accounts can access CARC systems.

> Note:  USC policy strictly forbids the sharing of accounts. If you have students, staff, or postdocs that are working for you, they must have their own CARC account.
