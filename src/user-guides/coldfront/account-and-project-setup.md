All active USC members have access to ColdFront.  Only faculty and staff members can create Projects:
1. [Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)
2. Verify that you are identified as a PI account (faculty & staff only).  PIs should see a link/button to "Add a Project"
3. Create a project in ColdFront and request allocations for the resources you want access to (see steps below)

Once #1 and #2 above are complete, you must create a new project in our resource allocation management portal, ColdFront.  ColdFront allows faculty/staff to manage what resources at HPC they have access to, add/remove users to their group, and provide documentation to USC for annual reporting to the University.


To begin, [Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)  
**NOTE:  You must be on a USC network (either on campus or connected to the USC VPN) to access this site!**


STEP 1:  Before you will be able to run jobs or get access to any of HPC's resources, you will need to add a project:  
[Creating a new project](create-a-new-project)


STEP 2:  Then you will need to request an allocation to at least one compute resource (cluster, storage, cloud, etc) at HPC you'd like to use.  If you require access to more than one resource, you can request multiple allocations at this time:  
[Requesting new allocations](requesting-new-allocation)



STEP 3 (optional): You can also add users to your group that will get access to the resources you allow:  
[Adding users to your project and/or allocations](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)  
**NOTE: University policy strictly forbids the sharing of accounts so if you have students, staff or post-docs that are working for you, they must have their own HPC account.**  

**NOTE: After the project is created, allocation request is approved (might take a day or more), and adding users to your allocations - HPC/USC user accounts take at least one hour before the account is created & your project user(s) can log in to access the HPC systems. **
