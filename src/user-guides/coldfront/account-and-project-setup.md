All active USC members have access to ARC resources and the user portal, but only faculty and staff members can act as Principle Investigators (PIs). In the user portal, PIs can create projects, request resource allocations for their projects, and add other users (including students) to the projects they control.

Even though a PI can log in to the user portal, they won't have access to ARC resources by default. In order to start using ARC resources, PIs must create a project and request a resource allocation for it. Adding users to a project is optional.

The following is an overview of the steps required to start using ARC resources. For more detailed instructions, see each individual user guide linked below.

To begin, [Log in to the user portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/).

> Note:   You must be on a USC network (either on campus or connected to the [USC VPN](https://itservices.usc.edu/vpn/)) to access the user portal!**

STEP 1: To verify that you are identified as a PI account, navigate to the "Projects" tab. PIs should see a button to "+Add a Project" on the left hand side of the screen.

STEP 2:  Before you will be able to run jobs or get access to any of ARC's resources, you will need to create a project:  

[Create New Project](create-a-new-project)  

Generally, each PI should have one project. Some PIs may require additional projects depending on their roles at USC. Anyone teaching classes should create a separate project for each course taught, and these projects can be reused each semester.  Also, anyone using the cluster for work outside their general research area should create a separate project.

> Note:  6/01/2020: HPC migrated all projects owned by a valid PI from our old uschpc cluster to the Discovery cluster as a convenience. Projects where the PI is a student were NOT migrated to the user portal.**

STEP 3:  Next, you will need to request an allocation to at least one compute resource (cluster, storage, cloud, etc.) at ARC that you'd like to use:

[Request New Allocation](request-new-allocation)

If you require access to more than one resource, you can request multiple allocations. Allocation requests can take a day or longer to be approved by the ARC team.

STEP 4 (optional): You can also add users to your project/allocation that will get access to the resources you grant them access to:  

[Adding Users](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)  

There is a delay of at least one hour before user accounts can access ARC systems.

> Note:  USC policy strictly forbids the sharing of accounts. If you have students, staff, or postdocs that are working for you, they must have their own ARC account.**
