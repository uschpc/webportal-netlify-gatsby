excerpt: ColdFront user portal - create new project
---

Each PI should have one project. Some PIs may require additional projects depending on their roles at USC. Anyone teaching classes should create a separate project for each course taught, and these projects can be reused each semester.  Also, anyone using the cluster for work outside their general research area should create a separate project.

> Note:  6/01/2020: HPC migrated all projects owned by a valid PI from our old uschpc cluster to the Discovery cluster as a convenience. Projects where the PI is a student were NOT migrated to the user portal.**

### User portal home page
To create a new project, click on either the Projects link or the Project menu tab - [Project Page](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/project/)

Entering your publication and grant information is not required to get started, but this information will be required to be updated on your [project renewal date each year](yearly-project-renewal).

**To get started, you will need to request an allocation to a resource**. If you have other researchers working on your project, you can add users to your project. Please see the links below for instructions:  

[Request New Allocation](request-new-allocation)  
[Adding Users](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)
