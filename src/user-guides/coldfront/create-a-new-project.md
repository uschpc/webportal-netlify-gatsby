[Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)  
**NOTE: Every faculty/staff should have at least one project.  Faculty/Staff members may require additional projects depending on their roles at the university.  Anyone teaching classes should create projects for each course taught (these projects can be reused from semester to semester).  Also, anyone using the industry cluster for work outside their general research should create a separate project.**

While the majority of the information is not required to get started, publication and grant information will be required to be updated on your renewal date each year.  

**At minimum, you will need to request an allocation to a resource** and can, if desired, add users to your project.  Please see the links below for instructions:
