Each PI should have one project. Some PIs may require additional projects depending on their roles at USC. Anyone teaching classes should create a separate project for each course taught, and these projects can be reused each semester. Also, anyone using the cluster for work outside their general research area should create a separate project for that work. This includes student research projects, which can be created as separate projects with a graduate student project (GSP) allocation.

### User portal home page
To create a new project, click on either the Projects link or the Project menu tab to access the [Projects Page](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/project/).

### Projects page
Click on the "+Add a Project" button.

### Add/Create Project page
Fill out the 4 fields:
* **Title**:
  * The title of your project should be concise but descriptive of the work being done. Avoid titles such as "My project" or "Project 1".
* **Description**:
  * The description should include a brief summary of the work that is being done as well as the project's goal.
* **Field of science**:
  * This drop-down list was taken from the National Science Foundation. If your field is not listed, please choose "Other".
* **Cluster Type**:
  * Discovery/Endeavour: Discovery and Endeavour are the CARC's high-performance computing clusters. Discovery is the general use, free, shared cluster, and Endeavour is the [condo cluster](/user-information/ccp). Most projects will use Discovery, but both clusters are considered as one cluster type in the User Portal.

and click the "Save" button.

### Project Detail page

You will then be able to view all of your project information on the Project Detail page:

Entering your publication and grant information is not required to get started, but this information will be required to be updated on your [project renewal date each year](yearly-project-renewal).

**Your next step is to request an allocation to a resource**. If you have other researchers working on your project, you can add users to your project. Please see the links below for instructions:  

[Request New Allocation](request-new-allocation)  
[Adding Users](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)
