Each PI should have one project. Some PIs may require additional projects depending on their roles at USC. Anyone teaching classes should create a separate project for each course taught, and these projects can be reused each semester. Also, anyone using the cluster for work outside their general research area should create a separate project for that work. This includes student research projects, which can be created as separate projects with a graduate student project (GSP) allocation.

### User portal home page
To create a new project, click on either the Projects link or the Project menu tab to access the [Projects Page](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/project/).

### Projects page
Click on the "+Add a Project" button.

### Add/Create Project page
Fill out the 4 fields:
* Title:
  * The title of your project should be concise but descriptive of the work being done. Avoid titles such as "My project" or "Project 1".
* Description:
  * The description should include a brief summary of the work that is being done as well as the project's goal.
* Field of science:
  * This drop-down list was taken from the National Science Foundation. If your field is not listed, please choose "Other".
* Cluster Type:
  * **Discovery (Cluster Partition)**: CARC's main computing resource available to all USC faculty/staff and their students/collaborators. Most CARC researchers should be choosing Discovery as their cluster type.
  * In the future we will have additional cluster options: **Condo** and **AWS Cloud**.

and click the "Save" button.

### Project Detail page
You will then be able to view all of your project information on the Project Detail page:

Entering your publication and grant information is not required to get started, but this information will be required to be updated on your [project renewal date each year](yearly-project-renewal).

**Your next step is to request an allocation to a resource**. If you have other researchers working on your project, you can add users to your project. Please see the links below for instructions:  

[Request New Allocation](request-new-allocation)  
[Adding Users](adding-users-to-project-or-allocation)
