Endeavour is the CARC's condo cluster, as part of the Condo Cluster Program (CCP). The CCP allows research groups to **subscribe** to their selected number of compute and storage resources on a yearly basis. The resources that a research group subscribes to will be dedicated for use by their condo job queue. See the CARC's [Condo Cluster Program Information page](/user-information/ccp/program-information) for details.  

The CARC also offers a traditional, five-year purchase model for condo resources. See the [Request New Condo Purchase user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-purchase) for more information.

### Subscription term 

Each subscription term is for one year from the date it is requested. Due to limitations with the administration of annual budgets by USC departments, the CARC is unable to offer multi-year subscription terms. However, at the end of a term, researchers can choose to renew or discontinue use of their resources. In the case of renewal, researchers will have the option to increase or decrease the size of their compute pool. 

Subscriptions can be started at any point during the year. At the end of the fiscal year (June 30) in which the subscription is started, the CARC will bill the department associated with the user account of the PI who requested the subscription. For instructions on how to add billing information to your account, see the [Add Billing Information user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/adding-billing-information).

### Requesting an allocation

Subscriptions are requested in the Research Computing User Portal much in the same way as regular Discovery allocations are requested.

In the User Portal, click on the name of the project that you are requesting a subscription for to be taken to that project's Project Detail page:

![ColdFront Project page](/images/coldfront_project_detail.gif)

To request a new subscription for a resource, click on the green Request Resource Allocation button on the Project Detail page.

You will then be taken to the Request New Allocation page:

![ColdFront New Allocation](/images/coldfront_new_subscription.png)

Select **Endeavour (Cluster Partition) - Condo Subscription** as your resource and provide a justification for access to that resource. Your justification should include information on how you'll be using the resource and how many CPU/service unit hours you anticipate needing to use.

Select the type of nodes you'd like to subscribe to, as well as the number of nodes. If required, select the users on your project to which you'd like to grant access to this allocation.

You'll have to read the Terms and Conditions before completing your request. If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, please contact us at <carc-condo@usc.edu> before submitting your request.

Click the Submit button when done.

#### Allocation Status: New
Your allocation will now display on your Project Detail page with a status of "New".

#### Allocation Status: Active
Once verified and approved by the CARC, the status will be changed to "Active" and you will have access to that resource for your project:

### Project Review
If you have not completed a project review in the last 365 days, you will be required to do this before requesting any allocations.  You will see this error:

More information about the project review process can be found [here](yearly-project-renewal).

### PIs with departmental clusters

If you would like a colleague to have access to your resource, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) to request this. It's important that you let the CARC know if that colleague is allowed to add users from their research group to your cluster. You will not be able to see any allocations or users that are added if this access is given.
