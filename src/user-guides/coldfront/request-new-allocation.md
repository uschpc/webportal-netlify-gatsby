### User portal home page

First, click on the name of the project that you are requesting an allocation for.

### Project Detail page
To request a new allocation for a resource, click on the Request Resource Allocation button in the Project Description Detail.

### Request New Allocation page

The Resource drop-down list contains the following resource options:

![ColdFront New Allocation](/images/coldfront_allocationnew.png)

* **Discovery (Cluster Partition)**: available to all USC faculty/staff and their students/collaborators.
* **Project Storage (Storage)**: additional storage you can purchase if you require more than the initial 1TB that ARC provides for free.

Select the resource you'd like access to and provide a justification for access to that resource. Your justification should include *what?*

If required, select the users on your project that you'd like to have access to this allocation.

Click the Submit button when done.

#### Allocation Status: Pending/New
Your allocation will now display on your Project Detail page with a status of "Pending".

#### Allocation Status: Active
Once verified and approved by ARC, the status will be changed to "Active" and you will have access to that resource for your project.

### Project Review
If you have not completed a project review in the last 365 days, you will be required to do this before requesting any allocations.  You will see this error:

More information about the project review process can be found [here](yearly-project-renewal).

### I want access to a resource that isn't in my list!
If there is a resource you think you should have access to but it's not in the drop-down list on the Request New Allocation page, please submit a help ticket to ARC.  If you would like access to a departmental server or a colleague's cluster, the PI responsible for the resource may need to request the allocation for you.  

### PIs with departmental clusters:
If you would like a colleague to have access to your resource, please submit a help ticket to request this.  It's important that you let us know if that colleague is allowed to add users from their research group to your cluster.  You will not be able to see any allocations or users that are added if this access is given.  If you have questions, please contact ARC.
