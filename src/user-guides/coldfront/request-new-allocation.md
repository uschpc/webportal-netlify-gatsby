[Log into ColdFront](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/)

### Request New Allocation page
To request a new allocation for a resource, click on the Request Resource Allocation button in the Project Description Detail.  A list of resources you potentially have access to will be displayed.

* **Discovery cluster** (available to all USC faculty, their students & collaborators)
* **Project Storage** = additional storage you can purchase if you require more than the initial 1TB HPC provides for free
* **Software licenses** = there are many options for software licenses.  Most of them will require you to agree to the terms of the license.  If you do not then you can cancel out of the request process by clicking the "back to project" button  

Select the resource you'd like access to and provide a justification for access to that resource.  Then select the users on your project that you'd like to have access to this allocation.  Click the Submit button when done.

### Allocation Status: Pending/New
Your allocation will now display on your Project Detail page with a status of "Pending"

&nbsp;  
### Allocation Status: Active
Once verified and approved by HPC (might take a few days), the status will be changed to "Active" and you will have access to that resource.

### Project Review:
If you have not completed the project review in the last 365 days, you will be required to do this first, before requesting any new allocations.  You will see this error:

**I want access to a resource that isn't in my list!**  
If there is a resource you think you should have access to but it's not on the list, please submit a HPC help ticket.  If you would like access to a departmental server or colleague's cluster, the PI responsible for the resource may need to request the allocation for you.  

**PIs with departmental clusters:**  
If you would like a colleague to have access to your resource, please submit a help ticket to request this.  It's important that you let us know if that colleague is allowed to add users from their research group to your cluster.  You will not be able to see any allocations or users that are added if this access is given.  If you have questions, please contact HPC help.
