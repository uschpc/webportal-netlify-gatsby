### Adding Publications:
We ask faculty to upload their publication information that acknowledges HPC or in which the information contained directly relates to work done at HPC.  You are welcome to add all your publications to this list, if you'd like.  To add publications, click on the Add Publication button in the Project Description view.  
![ColdFront Add Publication](/images/coldfront_project_addpublication.jpg)


You'll be presented with a box to enter your DOI.  Copy and paste the full DOI number and then click the Search button:
![ColdFront Add Publication - search](/images/coldfront_project_addpublication_enter1.jpg)


If the search yields the correct result, click the "Add Publication to Project" button:
![ColdFront Add Publication - submit](/images/coldfront_project_addpublication_enter2.jpg)


You will then be redirected to the project detail page where you'll see your publication listed.  You will also see a label indicating the last time you updated publications on the project:
