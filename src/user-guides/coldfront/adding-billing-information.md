While most general-use resources offered by the CARC are free for USC students, faculty, and staff, there are some cases where payment is required. These include resource requests for the [Condo Cluster Program](/user-information/ccp) (subscription model and purchase model) and requests for project storage that exceeds the 10 TB maximum that each PI receives at no cost.

If you have PI permissions, you can update your default billing information in your user profile, which is accessed by clicking your username in the top right corner of the user portal's header:

Once you've added billing information to your user profile, this information will be automatically populated in any resource request form that requries billing information.
