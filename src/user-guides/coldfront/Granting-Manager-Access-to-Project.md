PIs can grant manager access to their projects to allow for a trusted graduate student or lab director to manage the user accounts and allocations on their projects.  This is done on a per project basis so if you want a TA or graduate student to manage the project you're using for your course but not your main research project, this is possible.


To grant a user manager access, go to the project you'd like them to have access to, click on the edit icon next to their username under the Actions column:
![Project Edit User](/images/coldfront_project_edituser.jpg)

Change the drop down option from User to Manager and click the Update button: 
![Project User Detail](/images/coldfront_project_userdetail.jpg)


When you return to the Project Description view you will now see that user listed as a manager:
![Project Users - view manager](/images/coldfront_project_usermanager.jpg)


When that user logs into Coldfront, he/she will see your project and be able to add/remove users, request new allocations, and manage publications and grants.


**If at any time, you want to remove this elevated access, simply go back into the user editor and change the Manager to User in the drop down list.**
