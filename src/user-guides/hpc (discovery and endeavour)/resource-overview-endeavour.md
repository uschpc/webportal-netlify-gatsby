excerpt: Information on compute nodes and job limits for the Endeavour condo cluster.
---

The Center for Advanced Research Computing's high-performance computing condo cluster, Endeavour, has over XX compute nodes available for users to run their jobs on. These nodes are only available to the researchers that lease/subscribe to them. For information on the CARC's Condo Cluster Program (CCP), see the [Condo Cluster Program pages](/user-information/ccp).

For general CARC system specifications, see our [System Information page](/user-information/system-information).

### Compute nodes

The chart below describes the various Linux computing partitions available on Endeavour, their names, and information on the partitionsâ€™ computing power. These nodes are restricted to researchers with subscriptions to the relevant partition.

|Partition|Nodes|CPUs|Memory (GB)|CPU type|GPUs|Nodelist |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|albash|3 |20|64|xeon-2640v4||d15-[42-44]|         
|albash|14|20|128|xeon-2640v4|gpu:p100:2(S:0-1)|e23-[03-16]|
|nmlhpcc|2|24|94|xeon-4116||d11-[48-49]|
|nmlhpcc|2|20|64|xeon-2640v4||d15-[09-10]|

### Job limits

Job limits on Endeavour are more flexible than on Discovery and can be configured on a partition basis, but we still must enforce time limits for maintainence.

|Queue (or partition)| Default run time| Maximum run time|  Maximum concurrent cores|   Maximum number of jobs or job steps (running or pending)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|TBD  | 30 minutes| 30  minutes| 24    | 5     |
