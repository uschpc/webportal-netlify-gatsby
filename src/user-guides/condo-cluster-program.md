The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is an ongoing, subscription-based service from the University of Southern Californiaâ€™s Center for Advanced Research Computing. The CCP provides computing resources in support of research in a variety of disciplines, including epigenetics, geophysics, materials science, engineering, natural language translation, and health sciences. All computing resources for the CCP are owned and maintained by CARC.

The CARC is currently developing the policies for the new Condo Cluster Program. Later in 2020, information on the new Condo Cluster Program, including available resources, pricing, and the enrollment process, will be made available on this page.
