The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. 

The CARC is currently developing the policies for the new Condo Cluster Program. Later in 2020, information on the new Condo Cluster Program, including available resources, pricing, and the enrollment process, will be made available on the [Condo Cluster Program page](/user-information/ccp). If you're interested in learning more about subscribing to condo nodes in the meantime, please contact us at <carc-condo@usc.edu>.

**Current condo node owners**: You can still manage your resources at https://hpc-web.usc.edu/projects/. Support for condo nodes in the new CARC User Portal will be added once the CCP is developed.
