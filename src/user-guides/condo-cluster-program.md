The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. The CCP operates on an annual subscription-based model, with research groups subscribing to their selected number of compute and storage resources on a yearly basis. All of the hardware is purchased and maintained by the CARC throughout the course of the subscription term.

The CARC is currently developing the policies for the new Condo Cluster Program. Later in 2020, information on the new Condo Cluster Program, including available resources, pricing, and the enrollment process, will be made available on this page.
