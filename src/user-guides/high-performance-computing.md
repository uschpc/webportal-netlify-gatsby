High-performance computing (HPC) aggregates the resources from individual computers (known as nodes) into a cluster that works together to perform advanced, specialized computing jobs. The Center for Advanced Research Computing launched its new high-performance computing cluster, Discovery, in August 2020. For more information on HPC, see our [High-Performance Computing page](/services/hpc).
