[Python](https://www.python.org/) is an open-source, general purpose programming language whose strength comes in the tools and libraries that are associated with it.

### Using Python on CARC systems

Begin by logging in. You can find instructions for this in the [Getting Started with Discovery](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-discovery) or [Getting Started with Endeavour](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-endeavour) user guides.

To use Python, load the corresponding module:

```sh
module load python
```

This loads the default version, which is currently 3.7.6. To load a specific version, you can run a command similar to:

```sh
module load python/3.7.6
```

where `3.7.6` is the version you want. To see all available versions of Python, enter:

```sh
module spider python
```

#### Installing a different version of Python

If you want to use a different version of Python that is not currently installed on CARC systems, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) and we will install it for you. Alternatively, you can compile and install a different version of Python from source in your home or project directory.

#### Pre-installed packages

Many popular Python packages have already been installed on CARC systems. Use the `pip3 list` command to view them. You can install other Python packages that you need in your home directory (see section below).

#### Jupyter notebooks

Please note that we do not currently support the use of Jupyter notebooks on our systems. We will add support for Jupyter later in 2021 as part of a new hybrid cloud computing system.

### Installing Python packages

After loading the Python module (in this case, version 3), to install packages in your home directory, enter:

```sh
pip3 install --user <package_name>
```

For example, to install the Python package `csvkit`, enter:

```sh
pip3 install --user csvkit
```

By default, Python will install local (i.e., user) packages in your home directory (`~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`).

To install Python packages in a library other than the default, you can use the `--target` option with `pip3`. For example, to install a package in a project directory, enter:

```sh
pip3 install <package_name> --target /project/<project_id>/python/pkgs
```

where `<project_id>` is your project's account ID. To load packages from this location, ensure you have appended your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include this directory:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=/project/<project_id>/python/pkgs:${PYTHONPATH}
```

To automatically set this variable when logging in to the cluster, add this line to your `~/.bash_profile`. Additionally, add this line to your Slurm job scripts that depend on the packages installed in this location.

#### Creating virtual environments

You can also create environments for your packages. Python's virtual environments are isolated project environments designed to manage distinct package requirements and dependencies for different projects.

To create a virtual environment, navigate to the directory where you want it to be installed, such as your home or project directory, and enter:

```sh
python3 -m venv <env_name>
```

where `<env_name>` is the name of your environment. This will create a `<env_name>` subdirectory in the current directory. To activate the environment, enter:

```sh
source <env_name>/bin/activate
```

This will be reflected in your shell prompt:

```sh
(<env_name>) user@discovery:~$
```

Now when you install packages, they will automatically be installed in your `<env_name>` environment and directory (e.g., `./<env_name>/lib/python3.7/site-packages`). Additionally, add a similar line to your Slurm job scripts that use this Python environment, but be sure to include the absolute path.

To deactivate the environment, enter `deactivate`.

### Running Python interactively

Running Python interactively will allow you to test out any installations and compiler settings without submitting and waiting for a Slurm script.

After loading the module, on the **login node** you can run Python 3.x interactively by entering the command `python3`. For versions 2.x, enter the command `python`.

To run Python interactively on a **compute node**, use Slurm's `salloc` command to request compute resources:

```sh
salloc --time=1:00:00 --cpus-per-task=8 --mem-per-cpu=2GB --account=<account_id>
```

Each argument to the `salloc` command is described below:

|Slurm argument|Meaning|
|----|----|
|`--time=1:00:00` | Reserves resources described for 1 hour. Acceptable time formats include "minutes", "minutes:seconds", "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds"|
|`--cpus-per-task=8` | Reserves 8 CPUs for your exclusive use|
|`--mem-per-cpu=2GB` |  Reserves 2 GB per CPU of memory for your exclusive use|
|`--account=<account_id>` | Charges compute time to <account_id>. If not specified, you may use up the wrong PI's compute hours|

A more comprehensive list of `salloc`/`sbatch` options can be found [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html).

Once you are logged in to a compute node, load the module and enter `python3` or `python` to run Python interactively.

To run Python scripts from within Python, use the command `exec(open('script.py').read())`. Alternatively, to run Python scripts from the shell, use the `python3 script.py` command.

### Running Python in batch mode

In most scenarios, you will want to create a Slurm script to run your code without your input.

After creating your Python script, you will need to create a Slurm job script to launch your Python program. The Slurm script might look like this:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
    
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=10GB
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --account=<account_id>
    
module load gcc/8.3.0
module load python/3.7.6
    
python3 /path/to/script.py
```

Each line is described below:

|Command or Slurm argument|Meaning|
|----|----|
|`#!/bin/bash`|Use `/bin/bash` to execute this script |
|`#SBATCH`| Syntax that allows Slurm to read your requests (ignored by bash)|
|`--ntasks=1` |  Ensures all resources stay on a single compute node|
|`--cpus-per-task=4` | Reserves 4 CPUs for your exclusive use|
|`--mem-per-cpu=10GB` |  Reserves 10 GB per CPU of memory for your exclusive use|
|`--time=1:00:00` | Reserves resources described for 1 hour|
|`--account=<account_id>` | Charges compute time to <account_id>. If not specified, you may use up the wrong PI's compute hours|
|`module load gcc/8.3.0` | Load the `gcc` compiler [environment module](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/lmod)|
|`module load python/3.7.6` | Load the `python` [environment module](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/lmod)|
|`python /path/to/script.py` | Use `python` to run `script.py`|

Save this Slurm script as `python.slurm`, for example, and then submit it to the job scheduler like so:

```sh
sbatch python.slurm
```

You can use the following `script.py` as an example. Make sure to save it in the same directory as `python.slurm`.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
Y, X = np.mgrid[-3:3:200j, -3:3:200j]
  
x_pos=np.array((-1,-1,1, 1)) # X positions of point charges
y_pos=np.array((1, -1,1,-1)) # Y positions of point charges
q=np.array((-1,+1,+1,-1))    # Charge of point charges
  
# Calculate x and y components of electric field due to point charge
def Ex(x0,y0,q):
    return -q*(X-x0)/((X-x0)**2+(Y-y0)**2)
def Ey(x0,y0,q):
    return -q*(Y-y0)/((X-x0)**2+(Y-y0)**2)
  
# Calculate electric field due to multiple point charges
Ex_total=Ex(x_pos[0],y_pos[0],q[0])+Ex(x_pos[1],y_pos[1],q[1])+Ex(x_pos[2],y_pos[2],q[2])+Ex(x_pos[3],y_pos[3],q[3])
Ey_total=Ey(x_pos[0],y_pos[0],q[0])+Ey(x_pos[1],y_pos[1],q[1])+Ey(x_pos[2],y_pos[2],q[2])+Ey(x_pos[3],y_pos[3],q[3])
E_total=np.sqrt((Ex_total**2+Ey_total**2))
  
# Clip E_total for aesthetic purposes
clipped=np.clip(E_total,0,np.sqrt(3))
  
# Plot electric field lines, set color based on field strength
fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots(1,1)
strm = ax1.streamplot(X, Y, Ex_total, Ey_total, color=clipped, linewidth=2, density=1,cmap='PiYG')
fig1.colorbar(strm.lines)
  
# Plot position of point charges
ax1.plot(x_pos, y_pos, 'ro')
  
# Display plot, only works if X11 Forwarding is enabled
plt.show()
  
# Save plot to working directory
plt.savefig("plot.png",dpi=300)
print("Plot saved!")
```
