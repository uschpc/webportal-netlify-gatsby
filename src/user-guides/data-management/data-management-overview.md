Efficient and reliable data transfer can be achieved with a variety of useful tools, depending on if the storage location is a personal workstation or an external site. The choice of data transfer method depends heavily on the requirement of data sensitivity as well as familiarity of the user.

There are three methods of data transfer that we recommend for use with Discovery: **command line tools**, **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)**, and the **Globus web interface**.

### Command Line Tools

Researchers experienced with the command line can use command line tools to transfer data between their computers and the Discovery storage systems. Tools such as `sftp`, `rsync`, and `scp` can be used to efficiently transfer files.

For more information on transferring data using the command line, see our [Transferring Files using the Command Line user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/transferring-files-command-line).

### Graphical SFTP Clients

Programs such as Filezilla, Cyberduck, and WinSCP provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to transfer data between a personal machine and a storage solution that allows `scp` or `sftp`, such as Discovery. These programs offer drag-and-drop capability and are suitable for those users who might be unfamiliar with the command line.

For more information on transferring data using a GUI, see our [Transferring Files using a Graphical User Interface user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/transferring-files-gui).

### Globus

Globus is a data management service that allows researchers to have unified access to data through a web interface. It can be used to transfer data from a personal workstation to storage systems on Discovery. Globus also supports data transfers from other universities or supercomputing facilities.

For more information on transferring data using Globus, see our [Transferring Files using Globus user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/transferring-files-globus).
