Working with sensitive data that is governed by compliance regulations comes with additional requirements and restrictions that must be taken into consideration. The Center for Advanced Research Computing is currently developing a secure computing environment for such data. Later in 2020, details and system specifications will be made available on this page.

For details on USC's policies related to information security, including access and asset management, data protection, and information risk management, please see the Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO)'s [Information Security Policies & Standards page](https://trojansecure.usc.edu/information-security-policies/). You will need to log in with your USC NetID to view this page.
