The Center for Advanced Research Computing is currently formulating a long-term hybrid cloud solution. The CARC will be building services to allow researchers to utilize public, private, or hybrid cloud solutions in an effective, cost-efficient, and secure manner.

Currently, the CARC can assist you with facilitating access to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform through USC's IT Services. For more information, see our AWS Account Setup user guide below.
