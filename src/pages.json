No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).\n\n**Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm.** Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all CARC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email carc-support@usc.edu for assistance.\n\n**Consultations**: Consultations for CARC account holders are available outside of regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:\n\n > New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the CARC's services,\n\n > CARC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting, and\n\n > Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nIf you'd like to request a consultation, please fill out a [consultation request](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb). Currently, all consultations are taking place via Zoom.\n\n**New Users Meetings**: New users to the CARC are highly encouraged to sign up for a short introductory meeting that includes a presentation and discussion on CARC resources and using the CARC for your research.\n\nTo register for a New Users Meeting, please submit a request [here](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb) and specify that you're requesting a New Users Meeting. Currently, all New Users Meetings are taking place via Zoom.\n"}]
