No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).\n\n**Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm**. Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all ARCC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email hpc@usc.edu for assistance.\n\n**Consultations**: Consultations for ARCC account holders are available outside of  regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:\n\n* New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the ARCC's services.\n* ARCC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting.\n* Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nPlease fill out a [consultation request](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb) to speak with a research computing facilitator.
