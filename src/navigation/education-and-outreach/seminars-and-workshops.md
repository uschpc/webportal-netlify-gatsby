Each month, the CARC's Research Facilitation & Applications team offers a number of workshops designed to introduce users to the computing cluster and its features.

All workshops are approximately two hours in length and are offered several times a year. Workshops are announced via the hpc-announce-l@usc.edu mailing list. All CARC account holders and members are added to this list automatically.

>Note: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all workshops are currently being held over Zoom.

The Research Facilitation & Applications team is frequently developing new workshops for CARC users, including workshops on useful software and programming languages. Currently, we offer the following workshops on a rotating basis:

### **Introduction to HPC**

An overview of the USC high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. This workshop covers how to connect, where and how to download files, the software repository, and using the batch job scheduler.

### **Introduction to Linux**

This workshop covers the basic skills needed to be productive in a command line environment. It covers navigating the file system, running commands, file permissions, and basic bash scripting.

### **Installing Software**

An overview of common methods for building software. This workshop covers pre-built binaries, building code from source, and building code with dependent software.

### **Introduction to R**

An introduction to the R programming environment and language for statistical computing and graphics. This workshop covers base R concepts and functions for importing, exporting, processing, summarizing, visualizing, and modeling data. It also covers how to install packages and develop R scripts and discusses best practices for R programming.
