**To see which courses are being taught by the CARC this month, see our [Events page](/news-and-events/events).**

Each month, the CARC's Research Facilitation & Applications team offers a number of workshops designed to introduce users to the computing cluster and its features.

All workshops are approximately two hours in length and are offered several times a year. Workshops are announced via the hpc-announce-l@usc.edu mailing list and the monthly [CARC newsletter](https://usc.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1bdd19e9fa2d811ef66b3485a&id=a97e98a50e).

>Note: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all workshops are currently being held over Zoom.

The Research Facilitation & Applications team is frequently developing new workshops for CARC users, including workshops on useful software and programming languages. Currently, the following workshops are offered on a rotating basis:

### Research computing essentials

#### Introduction to HPC

An overview of the CARC high-performance computing (HPC) cluster. This workshop covers how to connect, where and how to download files, the software repository, and using the batch job scheduler.

#### Introduction to Linux

This workshop covers the basic skills needed to be productive in a command line environment. It covers navigating the file system, running commands, file permissions, and basic bash scripting.

#### Software Modules on Discovery

This workshop introduces CARC users to Discovery's software module system using Lmod, a Lua-based module system. Users will learn how to manage their environment, find software, and load modules. This workshop is recommended for new users and for experienced CARC users who may not be familiar with a module system.

### Advanced topics in research computing

#### Installing Software

This workshop is designed for researchers who need to install software packages on CARC systems. Using examples, we will cover concepts such as Python package installation, downloading software, linking to libraries, using Makefiles, compiling and optimizing code, and handling dependencies. It is recommended that you take the Introduction to Linux workshop first if you have not previously worked in a Linux environment.

### Programming

#### Introduction to Python

An introduction to the Python programming language. This workshop covers basic Python syntax, installing and importing packages, visualizing data, and writing scripts.

#### Introduction to R

An introduction to the R programming environment and language for statistical computing and graphics. This workshop covers base R concepts and functions for importing, exporting, processing, summarizing, visualizing, and modeling data. It also covers how to install packages and develop R scripts, and it discusses best practices for R programming.

#### HPC with R

This workshop covers intermediate topics in R programming using the CARC's high-performance computing cluster, Discovery, including data I/O, big data, memory usage, parallel computing, debugging, and profiling.

#### Running Parallel MATLAB on the CARC Cluster

This workshop is designed to teach researchers how to use MATLAB’s Parallel Computing Toolbox on the CARC cluster. This hands-on tutorial will cover topics such as creating and submitting parallel MATLAB job scripts with PBS, porting a serial MATLAB script to a parallel script, and optimizing CPU and memory usage. It is recommended that you take an introductory workshop first if you have not previously worked in a Linux or high-performance computing environment.

### Research applications

#### CP2K: Running Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations

An introduction to computational tools implemented within the CP2K program package. The most standard methods as well as some of the more advanced features will be introduced by overviews of background theory and through examples of application, while encouraging modular, flexible, and problem-oriented thinking. Recurring topics in the workshop are the scaling of algorithms, the combination of different levels of theory and of sampling, and tools and strategies for the analysis of results.
