The CARC's Research Facilitation & Applications team offers a number of workshops designed to introduce users to CARC systems as well as workshops on using specific software and programming languages in a high-performance computing environment.

The workshops below are approximately two hours in length and are offered several times a year on a rotating basis. Workshops are listed on our [Events page](/news-and-events/events) and in the monthly [CARC newsletter](https://usc.us10.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=1bdd19e9fa2d811ef66b3485a&id=a97e98a50e).

> Note: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, all workshops are currently being held over Zoom.

### Research computing essentials

#### Introduction to CARC Systems

An overview of the CARC's high-performance computing clusters. This workshop covers how to log in, manage and transfer data, load and build software, and run and monitor jobs.

#### Introduction to the Unix Shell

An introduction to using the Unix shell that covers the basic skills needed to be productive in a command-line environment on Unix-like systems, including the CARC's high-performance computing clusters. This workshop covers how to run commands, navigate file systems, create and edit files, use pipes and filters, and develop shell scripts.

#### Software Management on CARC Systems

This workshop introduces users to the CARC's software stack, which uses Lmod, a Lua-based module system. Users will learn how to manage their environment, find software, load modules, and build their own domain-specific packages.

#### Data Management on CARC Systems

This workshop covers various topics in data management and transfer on CARC systems, including transfer tools, file permissions, file I/O, and backups.

#### Slurm Job Management

This workshop covers how to run and monitor jobs using the Slurm workload manager and job scheduler, including topics like requesting resources, evaluating resource use, running MPI jobs and job arrays, and setting up job dependencies.

### Advanced topics in research computing

#### Software Containers with Singularity

An overview of software containers and how to use Singularity to create and run containers for research and high-performance computing tasks. Singularity containers enable portable and reproducible computing environments and workflows. Build a container with a desired software environment and you can run it on personal or workstation computers, on the CARC's high-performance computing clusters, and in the cloud.

#### Methods for Automating Job Submission

CARC users may find themselves doing repetitive tasks like manually launching jobs, checking their job status, and deciding what kind of jobs to submit based on the results. This workshop covers methods for automating these tasks with tools like job arrays and workflow management software.

### Programming

#### Introduction to Python

An introduction to the Python programming language. This workshop covers basic Python syntax, installing and importing packages, visualizing data, and writing scripts.

#### HPC with Python

Intermediate-to-advanced topics for getting improved Python performance in an HPC cluster environment. Covers debugging, profiling, and parallel programming.

#### Introduction to R

An introduction to the R programming environment and language for statistical computing and graphics. This workshop covers basic R concepts and functions for importing, exporting, processing, summarizing, visualizing, and modeling data. It also covers how to install packages and develop scripts and discusses best practices for R programming.

### Research applications

#### CP2K: Running Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations

An introduction to computational tools implemented within the CP2K program package. The most standard methods as well as some of the more advanced features will be introduced by overviews of background theory and through examples of application, while encouraging modular, flexible, and problem-oriented thinking. Recurring topics in the workshop are the scaling of algorithms, the combination of different levels of theory and of sampling, and tools and strategies for the analysis of results.

#### Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package Workshop Series

This workshop series will benefit researchers who are interested in or are starting to learn about the application of theoretical methods and techniques for the study of the physics and chemistry of the solid state. These hands-on oriented workshops are targeted towards undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students who wish to use Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods in their research. The aim is to teach the basics of ab initio atomistic materials simulation using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) plane-wave pseudopotential code. The workshops will consist of lectures, demonstrations, and practical hands-on sessions using the Discovery HPC cluster.

Students will be trained in the efficient use of HPC resources (i.e., simulation efficiency: setup of production-level simulations, parallel scaling, multi-level parallelism, hybrid architectures). After completing the series of workshops, the researchers will be able to independently develop and carry through density functional theory calculations as well as to analyze and judge their results.

Topics covered include:

- Planewaves, k-points, Brillouin zones, and supercells
- Cell (structure) relaxation
- Single-point energies (using a high-density k-point mesh)
- Density of states, band structure, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis (LOBSTER)
- Reaction pathways using Nudged Elastic Band methods
- Structure and reactivity at solid surfaces
- Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles)
