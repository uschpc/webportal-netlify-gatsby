### Office hours

Office hours are an opportunity for CARC users to ask questions about anything related to research computing. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom **every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm**. Office hours are drop-in and do not require registration, but you will need a USC NetID to join the Zoom meeting.

To join office hours, [click here](https://usc.zoom.us/j/96307624417?pwd=Rm1FMGFVWjlHS25IVjgvSlUzZ1EyQT09#success) or see our [Events](/news-and-events/events) page.

### Consultations

Consultations for CARC account holders are available outside of regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:

 - New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the CARC's services.
 - CARC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting.
 - Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.

If you'd like to request a consultation, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) and select "Consultation Request" for the ticket category. Currently, all consultations are taking place via Zoom.

### Meetings for new users

New users to the CARC are highly encouraged to sign up for a short introductory meeting that includes a presentation and discussion on CARC resources and using the CARC for your research.

To register for a new user meeting, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) and specify that you're requesting a new user meeting. Currently, all new user meetings are taking place via Zoom.

### New faculty orientations

New faculty, junior faculty, and graduate students can schedule short, high-level presentations with our Research Facilitation & Applications team to learn more about CARC resources, policies, and sponsored research assistance. Please email <carc-support@usc.edu> to schedule one of these presentations.

For presentations to be held at new faculty orientations at the beginning of the academic year, please contact us well in advance to avoid potential scheduling conflicts.
