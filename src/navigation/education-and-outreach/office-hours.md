### Office Hours

Office hours are an opportunity for CARC users to ask questions about anything related to research computing. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm. Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all CARC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email <carc-support@usc.edu> for assistance.

### Consultations

Consultations for CARC account holders are available outside of regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:

 - New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the CARC's services.
 - CARC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting.
 - Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.

If you'd like to request a consultation, please fill out a [consultation request](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb). Currently, all consultations are taking place via Zoom.

### Meetings for new users

New users to the CARC are highly encouraged to sign up for a short introductory meeting that includes a presentation and discussion on CARC resources and using the CARC for your research.

To register for a New Users Meeting, please submit a request [here](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb) and specify that you're requesting a New Users Meeting. Currently, all New Users Meetings are taking place via Zoom.

### New faculty orientations

New faculty, junior faculty, and graduate students can schedule short, high-level presentations with our Research Facilitation & Applications team to learn more about CARC resources, policies, and sponsored research assistance. Please email <carc-support@usc.edu> to schedule one of these presentations.

For presentations to be held at new faculty orientations at the beginning of the academic year, please contact us well in advance to avoid potential scheduling conflicts.
