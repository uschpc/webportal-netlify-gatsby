### Publication acknowledgement in American Chemical Society's ACS Catalysis

#### Title: Pd-Catalyzed Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Cyclopropyl Vinyl Sulfides Reveals the Origin of High Selectivity in a Fundamental Alkyne Insertion Step

##### Collaborators: Liliya T. Sahharova, Evgeniy G. Gordeev, Dmitry B. Eremin, and Valentine P. Ananikov  

On August 19, 2020, the American Chemical Society's *ACS Catalysis* published "Pd-Catalyzed Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Cyclopropyl Vinyl Sulfides Reveals the Origin of High Selectivity in a Fundamental Alkyne Insertion Step," which included an acknowledgement for work done on the CARC's Discovery cluster by Dmitry B. Eremin. 

From the publication abstract:
>"We show that the insertion of alkyne into the Pd−S bond proceeds by an asynchronous mechanism, which starts with metal−carbon binding and resolves into diverse transient structures. We further demonstrate that dynamic involvement of these structures ensures regioselectivity of the entire process, thus providing a mechanistic link that has long been missing. Alkyne insertion into the metal−heteroatom bond is a fundamental elementary step and a corner stone of catalysis and organometallic chemistry that works for a large variety of metals and heteroatoms. Mastering its Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov selectivity provides powerful opportunities for the design of selective functionalization routes."

### Exascale Computing Project - Aurora Early Science Program

#### Title: Metascalable Layered Materials Genome

#### Collaborators: University of Southern California (Aiichiro Nakano, Ken-ichi Nomura, and BD Kim), Argonne National Laboratory, Intel, and Kumamoto University (Japan)



Project description: A project investigating layered materials (LMs) that hold the promise of producing electricity when exposed to light has been chosen for the Early Science Program on Aurora, the next major exascale supercomputer to launch at Argonne National Laboratory. This project will advance the layered materials genome (LMG). We will perform 105-atom non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) and 1010-atom reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations on Aurora for computational synthesis and characterization of LMs. The large-scale simulations will (1) guide the synthesis of stacked LMs by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), exfoliation and intercalation, and (2) discover function-property-structure relationships in LMs with a special focus on far-from-equilibrium electronic processes.

Tasks: (1) Provide HPC support and consulting; (2) With Intel compiler support for GPU offload now available, implement OpenMP offloading to GPUs for one of the most computationally expensive QXMD kernels in the Local Field Dynamics code.

### Grant from National Science Foundation's Future Manufacturing Program

#### Title: Artificial Intelligence Driven Cybermanufacturing of Quantum Material Architectures

#### Collaborators: University of Southern California (Aiichiro Nakano and Ken-ichi Nomura), Harvard University, and Howard University

Description: Quantum material architectures consist of graphene and other two-dimensional materials, which, when stacked in precise three-dimensional architectures, exhibit unique and tunable mechanical, electrical, optical, and magnetic properties. These three-dimensional architectures have broad potential applications and are highly promising components for microchips, batteries, antennas, chemical and biological sensors, solar-cells and neural interfaces. This grant is to develop a transformative Future Manufacturing platform for quantum material architectures using a cybermanufacturing approach, which combines artificial intelligence, robotics, multiscale modeling, and predictive simulation for the automated and parallel assembly of multiple two-dimensional materials into complex three-dimensional structures. A key outcome is an AI-driven, robotics-controlled cybermanufacturing microfluidic platform that is capable of manufacturing complex structures for emerging quantum and other device applications.

Tasks: (1) Provide HPC support and consulting; (2) Perform non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics simulations on complex, layered three-dimensional structures to determine stacking processes conducive to optimal performance for various device applications.

### Fluoride Ion Batteries

#### Title: Synthetic Control Across Length-scales for Advancing Rechargeables (SCALAR)

#### Collaborators: US Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Frontier Research Center (Class: 2018 - 2022)

#### USC Collaborators: Brent Melot, Chemistry Department

Description: The main goal of the project is to better understand the chemical and structural factors that allow for reversible (de)insertion of fluoride ions into intercalation host structures, to develop some rules for how to think about Fluoride Ion Batteries (FIBs) compared to Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) materials. Past work on fluoride transport has studied conversion type electrodes (e.g. converting lead metal into lead fluoride), which have interesting potential, but serious limitations in terms of cycling. Recent advances that might allow for success with reversible FIBs are the demonstration of room-temperature cycling with liquid electrolytes, and then recent work headed by Melot's group that shows F- insertion into ReO3. The problem is that F- is not reversible with ReO3, so learning from this we need to address the side reactions which occur that make it non-reversible, and there is a need to move to layered materials so that the intercalation channels are stable with respect to fluoride de-insertion.

Tasks: (1) Perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and reaction barrier calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the CP2K and VASP codes to study the complex (de)fluorination mechanisms in FIBs.

### Safe electrolytes compatible with both Li-metal anodes and high-voltage cathodes

#### Title: Developing Safer, Wide-Temperature Liquefied Gas Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Batteries

#### Collaborators: University of Southern California, US Army Research Laboratory, University of California San Diego, and South 8 Technologies

#### Principal Collaborator: Oleg Borodin, US Army Research Laboratory

Description: We endeavor to mitigate safety and practicality concerns of high-voltage Lithium Ion Battery electrolytes by demonstrating an enhanced safety feature inherent in liquefied gas electrolytes and by showing the viability of using difluoromethane as a liquefied gas solvent which has lower pressure, lower flammability, and improved maximum operation temperature characteristics compared with fluoromethane. We create a custom-built setup to enable liquefied gas electrolyte characterization through Raman spectroscopy and supplement this with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The demonstrated use of such alternative liquefied gas solvents opens a path towards the further development of high-energy and safe batteries that can operate in a wide-temperature range.

Tasks: (1) Perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and anode-electrolyte/cathode-electrolyte interface calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the CP2K and VASP codes to study the complex interfacial reaction mechanisms of novel liquefied gas electrolytes with lithium metal anodes and high-voltage cathodes.
