excerpt: Projects that the CARC is currently involved in or supporting.
---

The Center for Advanced Research Computing collaborates with researchers on their work in numerous ways. In addition to providing computing and storage resources, education, and user support, the CARC also works closely with researchers on their applications for research grants and awards and on their academic publications.

If you're interested in collaborating with the CARC on a grant proposal or crediting the CARC in your publication, please see our [Grant and Publication Support page](/services/grant-support).

The following are recent projects, publications, and awards that the CARC has contributed resources to or collaborated with researchers on.

###  Grant from National Science Foundation's Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Program

##### Collaborators: Carl Kesselman (Principal Investigator) and Byoung-Do Kim (Co-Principal Investigator)  

In August 2020, the National Science Foundation officially awarded Carl Kesselman, Director of Informatics Systems Research at USC's [Information Sciences Institute](https://www.isi.edu/), and BD Kim, Director of the Center for Advanced Research Computing, with a $400,000 grant for their proposal "CC* Compute: A Customizable, Reproducible, and Secure Cloud Infrastructure as a Service for Scientific Research in Southern California," as part of the Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) Program.

From NSF:
>"The Campus Cyberinfrastructure (CC*) program invests in coordinated campus-level networking and cyberinfrastructure improvements, innovation, integration, and engineering for science applications and distributed research projects. Learning and workforce development (LWD) in cyberinfrastructure is explicitly addressed in the program. Science-driven requirements are the primary motivation for any proposed activity."

### Publication credit in American Chemical Society's ACS Catalysis

##### Collaborators: Liliya T. Sahharova, Evgeniy G. Gordeev, Dmitry B. Eremin, and Valentine P. Ananikov  

On August 19, 2020, the American Chemical Society's *ACS Catalysis* published "Pd-Catalyzed Synthesis of Densely Functionalized Cyclopropyl Vinyl Sulfides Reveals the Origin of High Selectivity in a Fundamental Alkyne Insertion Step," which included an acknowledgement for work done on the CARC's Discovery cluster by Dmitry B. Eremin. 

From the publication abstract:
>"We show that the insertion of alkyne into the Pd−S bond proceeds by an asynchronous mechanism, which starts with metal−carbon binding and resolves into diverse transient structures. We further demonstrate that dynamic involvement of these structures ensures regioselectivity of the entire process, thus providing a mechanistic link that has long been missing. Alkyne insertion into the metal−heteroatom bond is a fundamental elementary step and a corner stone of catalysis and organometallic chemistry that works for a large variety of metals and heteroatoms. Mastering its Markovnikov vs anti-Markovnikov selectivity provides powerful opportunities for the design of selective functionalization routes."
