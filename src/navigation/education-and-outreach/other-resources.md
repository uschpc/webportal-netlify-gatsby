While the CARC offers [user guides](/user-information/user-guides) specific to its systems, there are many other online resources that are useful for improving your programming skills and deepening your understanding of research computing.

In addition to the following resources, CARC staff also regularly post resources and tips on our [User Forum](https://hpc-discourse.usc.edu/).

### Software Carpentry

Software Carpentry is a great resource for learning essential skills related to research computing. The organization offers in-person and online workshops that teach lessons on Unix, Git, and programming languages. The learning materials for these workshops are made available for free on [their website](https://software-carpentry.org/).

### LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com)

All USC faculty, staff, and students have free access to LinkedIn Learning's online training and development content using their USC NetID. The content offerings cover a wide range of topics, including technology and programming.

For more information on LinkedIn Learning, see https://itservices.usc.edu/linkedin-learning/.

### edX

Founded by MIT and Harvard, edX is a nonprofit organization that offers online courses from 140 higher education institutions. edX features both paid and no-cost courses that can be used to earn professional certificates and university credit.

### XSEDE

The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is an NSF-funded virtual organization that integrates and coordinates the sharing of advanced [digital services](https://www.xsede.org/web/site/ecosystem/services) - including supercomputers and high-end visualization and data analysis [resources](https://www.xsede.org/web/site/ecosystem/resources) - with researchers nationally to support science.

XSEDE regularly offers free workshops. Enrollment in XSEDE workshops requires creating a user account, which is free. Check out the full course calendar here: https://www.xsede.org/web/xup/course-calendar.
