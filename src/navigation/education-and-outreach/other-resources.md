While the CARC offers [user guides](/user-information/user-guides) specific to our systems, there are many other online resources that are useful for improving your programming skills and deepening your understanding of research computing.

### Software Carpentry

Software Carpentry is a great resource for learning essential skills related to research computing. The organization offers in-person and online workshops that teach lessons on Unix, Git, and programming languages.
