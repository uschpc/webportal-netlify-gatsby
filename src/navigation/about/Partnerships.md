The Center for Advanced Research Computing is proud to hold collaborative relationships with the organizations below. In addition to these, the CARC is actively seeking other partnerships that will broaden its research opportunities and expand its outreach.

### USC's Information Sciences Institute

The CARC works directly with the Information Sciences Institute at USC by collaborating on certain projects and grant proposals. As the CARC continues to develop its new systems, further collaboration on the ISI's multi-institutional projects is expected.

From [their website](https://www.isi.edu/):

"The Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is a world leader in research and development of advanced information processing, computer and communications technologies.

A unit of the University of Southern California’s highly ranked Viterbi School of Engineering, ISI is one of the nation’s largest, most successful university-affiliated computer research institutes. The Institute attracts over $100 million annually for basic and applied research from federal agencies and the private sector.

Our work ranges from theoretical basic research, such as core engineering and computer science discovery, to applied research and development, such as design and modeling of innovative prototypes and devices."

### The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE)

XSEDE is the nation's largest academic research computing community that facilitates the sharing of high-performance computing resources among researchers. The CARC is a member of the XSEDE community and benefits from access to other members' services. In the future, the CARC expects to share its own computing resources with members of the XSEDE community.

From [their website](https://www.xsede.org/):

"The Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) is an NSF-funded virtual organization that integrates and coordinates the sharing of advanced digital services - including supercomputers and high-end visualization and data analysis resources - with researchers nationally to support science.

Digital services provide users with seamless integration to NSF's high-performance computing and data resources. XSEDE's integrated, comprehensive suite of advanced digital services combined with other high-end facilities and campus-based resources, serve as the foundation for a national cyberinfrastructure ecosystem."
