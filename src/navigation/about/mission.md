Established in 2000, the University of Southern California's Advanced Research Computing Center (ARCC) aims to provide advanced computational research support to USC faculty and students.

When the needs of researchers exceed the capabilities of a personal computer, the ARCC offers its support. Examples of services offered include high-performance computing, data storage and analysis, cloud computing, secure computing for sensitive data, and customized research partnerships.

In June 2020, the ARCC launched its new high-performance computing cluster, Discovery. Discovery boasts insert specs

Besides computing power, Discovery also has the capability of storing and analyzing large datasets. As the amount of data required for computational research continues to grow, adequate storage solutions have become a vital component of cyberinfrastructure. Discovery insert specs

During its existence, the ARCC has continued to support and educate the USC community with computational research work. The use of ARCC resources can be invaluable for researchers looking to further their research through grants and publications. In addition to standard user support, the ARCC team also offers customized, collaborative research partnerships for researchers who traditionally have not benefited from the power of high-performance computing, but who recognize that their research requires access to more compute power.

The ARCC represents a collaborative, interdisciplinary partnership supported by numerous schools and departments across USC. It bridges USCâ€™s unique strengths in scientific computing, computer science, and communications by supporting more than 100 research groups in a variety of disciplines, including epigenetics, geophysics, materials science, engineering, natural language translation, and health sciences.

During its twenty-year history, the Advanced Research Computing Center has established itself as an invaluable resource for research work at USC. Today, after a major upgrade to its system and numerous other projects planned for the near future, the ARCC is poised to become an even more accessible and far-reaching part of the greater USC research community.
