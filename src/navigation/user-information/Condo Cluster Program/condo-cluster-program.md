excerpt: Information on the CARC's Condo Cluster Program, a service for USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work.
---

The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. Compute nodes leased through the CCP form the CARC's [Endeavour condo cluster](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-endeavour). 

The CCP operates on two different models - an annual subscription model and a traditional system purchase model - to provide researchers with flexible and efficient options for their resources.

Detailed information on the CCP can be found below.
