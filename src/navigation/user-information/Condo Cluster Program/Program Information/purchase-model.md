The traditional system purchase model is a useful option when research groups need to make a bulk purchase using a research grant or departmental budget, and it is also useful for grant proposal budget planning purposes.

Like the annual subscription model, research groups will have exclusive access to the resources they purchase. Principal Investigators (PIs) only need to purchase compute nodes (CPUs and/or GPUs), cables, and a 5-year manufacturer’s warranty service. Other equipment and services, including racks, network switches, power and cooling, system support, and machine room operation in our data center, is paid for by the university. 

### Compute resources available for purchase

The following table summarizes the CPU and GPU nodes that are available for purchase using the traditional purchase model:

#### CPU nodes

| CPU | CPU quantity | Memory (GB) | Estimated price |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Dual AMD EPYC 7542 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 256 GB | $12K |
| Dual AMD EPYC 7542 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 512 GB | $16K |
| --- |  |  |  |  |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6248R Processor 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | 192 GB | $11K |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6248R Processor 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | 384 GB | $14K |

#### GPU nodes

| CPU | CPU quantity | Memory (GB) | GPU | GPU quantity | Estimated price |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Dual AMD EPYC 7282 Processor 16-core 2.80GHz | 2 | 256 GB | RTX 5000 | 2 | $12.5K |
| --- |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dual AMD EPYC 7532 Processor 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 256 GB | V100s | 2 | $33K |
| Dual AMD EPYC 7532 Processor 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 256 GB | A100 | 2 | $40K |
| --- |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 4216 Processor 16-core 2.1GHz | 2 | 192 GB | RTX 5000 | 2 | $11K |
| Quad Intel Xeon Gold 4216 Processor 16-core 2.1GHz | 2 | 192 GB | RTX 5000 | 4 | $13K |
| --- |  |  |  |  |  |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6248R Processor 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | 192 GB | V100s | 2 | $31K |

> Example system specifications (Dell and HPE/Exxact) for each model of node can be downloaded from GitHub [here](https://github.com/uschpc/documentation-public/blob/master/20-21%20Example%20Condo%20Node%20Configs.xlsx). Final configurations of system specs will depend on system availability from the vendor.

### Pricing

Pricing may vary based on market condition and the CARC’s equipment purchase price. In addition to the cost of the selected CPU and/or GPU nodes, PIs will be charged for cables, chassis (if necessary), and sales tax. Pricing does not include interconnect hardware, second enclosure (racks), or utility costs for power and cooling, but ITS/CARC will cover the costs of this necessary service and equipment. The PI will not be charged any setup or recurring fees as part of this arrangement for the duration of this agreement, including CARC administrative support costs.

### How to request a condo purchase

A condo purchase request is possible during the CARC's annual condo purchase request period, which occurs during the fall semester. The whole process of purchase request, system configuration, vendor selection, purchasing, system installation, and deployment typically takes six months. The purchased resources will be in service for 5 years, and after this service period, the CARC will decommission these condo nodes. 

PIs use the [User Portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal) to select and purchase their desired condo resources. See the [Request New Condo Purchase user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-purchase) for detailed instructions.
