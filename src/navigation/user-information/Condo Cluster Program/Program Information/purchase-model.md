The traditional system purchase model is a useful option when research groups need to make a bulk purchase using a research grant or departmental budget, and it is also useful for grant proposal budget planning purposes.

Like the annual subscription model, research groups will have exclusive access to the resources they purchase. Principal Investigators (PIs) only need to purchase compute nodes (CPUs and/or GPUs), cables, and a 5-year manufacturer’s warranty service. Other equipment and services, including racks, network switches, power and cooling, system support, and machine room operation in our data center, is paid for by the university. 

### Compute resources available for purchase

The following table summarizes the CPU and GPU nodes that are available for purchase using the traditional purchase model:

#### CPU nodes

| CPU model | CPU quantity | Memory (GB) | Estimated price |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Dual AMD EPYC 7542 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 256 GB | $12K |
| Dual AMD EPYC 7542 32-core 2.90GHz | 2 | 512 GB | $16K |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6248R 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | 192 GB | $11K |
| Dual Intel Xeon Gold 6248R 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | 384 GB | $14K |

#### GPU nodes

| GPU model | GPU quantity | CPU model | CPU quantity | Estimated price |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| RTX 5000 (16GB GDDR6, 3K CUDA cores) | 2 | AMD EPYC 7282 16-core 2.80GHz | 2 | $13K |
| V100s (32GB HBM2, 5K CUDA cores) | 2 | AMD EPYC 7532 32-core 2.40GHz | 2 | $33K |
| A100 (40GB HBM2, 10K CUDA cores) | 2 | AMD EPYC 7532 32-core 2.40GHz | 2 | $40K |
| RTX 5000 (16GB GDDR6, 3K CUDA cores) | 2 | Intel Xeon Gold 4216 16-core 2.1GHz | 2 | $13K |
| RTX 5000 (16GB GDDR6, 3K CUDA cores) | 4 | Intel Xeon Gold 4216 16-core 2.1GHz | 2 | $17K |
| V100s (32GB HBM2, 5K CUDA cores) | 2 | Intel Xeon Gold 6248R 24-core 3.0GHz | 2 | $31K |

### Pricing

Pricing may vary based on market condition and the CARC’s equipment purchase price. In addition to the cost of the selected CPU and/or GPU nodes, PIs will be charged for cables, chassis (if necessary), and sales tax. Pricing does not include interconnect hardware, second enclosure (racks), or utility costs for power and cooling, but ITS/CARC will cover the costs of this necessary service and equipment. The PI will not be charged any setup or recurring fees as part of this arrangement for the duration of this agreement, including CARC administrative support costs.

### How to request a condo purchase

A condo purchase request is possible during the CARC's annual condo purchase request period, which occurs during the fall semester. The whole process of purchase request, system configuration, vendor selection, purchasing, system installation, and deployment typically takes six months. The purchased resources will be in service for 5 years, and after this service period, the CARC will decommission these condo nodes. 

PIs use the [User Portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal) to select and purchase their desired condo resources. See the [Request New Condo Purchase user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-purchase) for detailed instructions.

**The condo purchase request period is currently open. The deadline to submit a purchase request is February 19, 2021**.
