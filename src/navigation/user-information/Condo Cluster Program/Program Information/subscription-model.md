The annual subscription-based model allows research groups to subscribe to their selected number of compute and storage resources on a yearly basis. The resources that a research group subscribes to will be dedicated for use by their condo job queue. All of the hardware is purchased and maintained by the CARC throughout the course of the subscription term.

At the end of the annual subscription period (typically at the end of the fiscal year, June 30), researchers can choose to renew or discontinue use of their resources. In the case of renewal, researchers will have the option to increase or decrease the size of their compute pool or storage space. 

### Compute resources available for subscription

Currently, the CARC offers two different compute node configurations to choose from. The table below summarizes the technical specifications and pricing of available nodes.

| Model | # of cores per node | GHz | Memory (GB) | Price per year |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Lenovo NX360 | 16 | 2.6 | 64 GB | $400 |
| Lenovo NX360 | 20 | 2.6 | 64 GB | $500 |

> We recognize that these are not the latest and greatest compute nodes currently on the market, and the low subscription price reflects this. We are currently in the process of purchasing a new batch of compute nodes for the Condo Cluster Program. The COVID-19 situation has delayed this process, but the new compute nodes will be available for subscription on the Endeavour cluster in early 2021. 

### How to subscribe to resources

Subscriptions to condo compute nodes can be requested via the CARC's User Portal, just as you would request a resource allocation for the Discovery cluster.

See the [Request New Allocation user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-allocation) for details on how to request a condo subscription for your research project.
