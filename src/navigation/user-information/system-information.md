In 2020, the Center for Advanced Research Computing performed a major upgrade to its systems. The new high-performance computing cluster, Discovery, includes additional compute nodes and a rebuilt software stack, as well as new system configurations to better serve CARC users. A new, high-performing project file system was also deployed, offering more storage space and better performance.

### Computing Resources

The CARC computing resource consists of 2 shared head nodes and a total of 30,000 CPU cores in 1,600 compute nodes. The typical compute node has dual 8 to 16 core processors and resides on a 56 gigabit FDR Infiniband backbone.

### File Systems

Each user has three file systems for their CARC account: the home directory, the project directory, and the scratch directory.

For more information on our different file systems, see our [Storage File Systems user guide](/user-information/user-guides/data-management/storage-file-systems).

#### Home directory

Every user on Discovery has a 100GB allocation of home directory space. The home directory should be used for configuration files and personal scripts, but not for the bulk of your research work.

#### Project file system

The new parallel project file system was deployed during the summer of 2020. This file system has a capacity of ***~10PB***.

The project file system should be used for most of your CARC work, and it's also where you can collaborate with your research project group. Each project group member will have their own subdirectory within their group's project directory, where they can store data, scripts, and related files.

#### Scratch file systems

The scratch directories - /scratch and /scratch2 - are high-performance parallel file systems, so you can run IO-intensive jobs directly from them.

/scratch has a capacity of 806TB, and /scratch2 has a capacity of 709TB.

### Operating System

The CARC uses a customized distribution of the Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS), built using the publicly available RPM Package Manager (RPM).  CentOS is a high-quality Linux distribution that gives the CARC complete control of its open-source software packages and is fully customized to suit advanced research computing needs, without the need for license fees.

The CARCâ€™s distribution of CentOS was modified for minor bug fixes and desired localized behavior. Many desktop and clustering-related packages were also added to our CentOS installation.

A number of white papers, tutorials, FAQs and other documentation on CentOS can be found on the [official CentOS website](https://www.centos.org/).
