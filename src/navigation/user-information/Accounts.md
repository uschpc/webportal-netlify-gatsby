excerpt: How to get access to your CARC account and what resources you have available.
---

All USC students, staff, and faculty have access to the Center for Advanced Research Computing's systems for their research projects. The CARC offers different types and sizes of computing and storage resource allocations for these projects.

### Access to CARC systems

In order to access the CARC's systems, you must either be the Principal Investigator (PI) of a research project or an authorized member of a PI's research project.

CARC systems are accessed using your USC NetID and password, so there is no additional requirement for CARC-specific account creation.

>Note: Your USC NetID is the first part of your USC email address (e.g., ttrojan@usc.edu's NetID is ttrojan).

Duo Two-Factor Authentication is also required. If you have not already signed up for Duo on your USC NetID account, please visit [this page](https://itservices.usc.edu/duo/enroll) to enroll.

Access to and use of resources is based on participation in projects. Project setup and resource allocation requests must be made by a project's PI using the [Research Computing User Portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/). Detailed instructions for project and resource management are available in the [Research Computing User Portal user guides](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal).

For step-by-step instructions on how to log in to our HPC clusters, see the [Getting Started with Discovery](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-discovery) (general use cluster) and [Getting Started with Endeavour](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/getting-started-endeavour) (condo cluster) user guides.

### Principal Investigator (PI) eligibility

PhD-level researchers, which include faculty, research staff, and postdocs (but not PhD students), are eligible for PI status, which is required for project creation and allocation requests. If you're eligible for PI status, the Research Computing User Portal will recognize this when you log in and you will automatically be granted PI permissions (account creation, resource requests, adding users to a project, etc.).

If you believe you're eligible for PI status but this isn't reflected in the Research Computing User Portal, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) to the CARC.

### Discovery computing resource allocations

The CARC offers three types of computing resource allocations on the Discovery cluster: class, graduate student project, and research. For both resources, the unit of SU (System Unit) is used. One SU indicates one hour's use of a single CPU core.

#### Class allocations

The class allocation supports academic classes with limited size and timeline. It supports up to 10,000 SUs and expires at the end of a semester. Faculty who need a class allocation should request this resource in the Research Computing User Portal at least two weeks before the beginning of the semester.

#### Graduate student project (GSP) allocations

The graduate student project (GSP) allocation supports up to 100,000 SUs and is designed for students who conduct research work that is separate from a PI's main research project. A PI can create a project for a student and request a new GSP allocation for it in the [Research Computing User Portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal). A student seeking a GSP allocation still requires their PI/advisor to create the project and request the allocation for them, as only a PI can do this. 

> Note: This allocation was designed for graduate students, but a PI may also create this allocation for undergraduate students that they advise.

#### Research allocations

The research allocation has three size tiers depending on the computational needs of the associated projects. The allocation usually starts in the new fiscal year, and it must be renewed annually at the end of each fiscal year to continue the use of the allocation. Requests for new research allocations and renewals must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period/new fiscal year.

The table below shows a summary of the computing allocation tiers and their sizes.

| Allocation Type | Size (in SUs)       |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Small           | 200,000         |
| Medium          | 500,000         |
| Large           | 1,000,000       |

### Endeavour computing resource allocations 

Endeavour is the CARC's condo HPC cluster. As part of the [Condo Cluster Program (CCP)](/user-information/ccp), researchers can lease/subscribe to their own dedicated compute and storage nodes. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves.

The CCP operates on both an annual subscription-based model, with research groups subscribing to their selected number of compute and storage resources on a yearly basis, as well as a traditional purchase model, with research groups purchasing compute or storage resources from the CARC for a fixed term (e.g., five years). For more information on the computing resources available on Endeavour, see the [Condo Cluster Program Information page](/user-information/ccp/program-information).

### Storage resource allocations

All active projects are eligible for a storage allocation on the CARC project file system. Storage allocations are measured using disk space in terabytes (1 terabyte is equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes). When requesting a new storage allocation, the default minimum allocation size is 5 TB per project, and each PI can receive a maximum allocation of 10 TB across their project(s) at no cost. All users for a project will have access to that project's allocation.

If more than 10 TB is needed, a PI can request additional storage space through the [Research Computing User Portal](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal). The additional storage space in excess of the first 10 TB is a paid service. Additional storage space can be added in increments of 5 TB, and the current price is $40/TB/year. For example, when a PI requires 20 TB total of space, the annual cost for the data storage space will be:

>20 TB per year = 10 TB free + (10 x $40/TB/year) = $400 annual cost

If you're requesting a **new storage allocation** and require more than 10 TB, you can request your allocation in the [User Portal](http://hpcaccount.usc.edu) and indicate the amount of storage you need (in 5 TB increments). See the [Request New Allocation user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/request-new-allocation) for more information.

If you have an **existing storage allocation** but would like to increase the amount of storage, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) under the "Accounts/Access" category. Please include your project ID, desired allocation size, and reason for this increase. The CARC team will consult with you to determine your needs and the total cost.

### Yearly renewal of allocations

The duration of computing and storage resource allocations is  one year. Each year, PIs must renew their projects and associated allocations in the Research Computing User Portal. Changes to allocation sizes or types can be made during this renewal. Failure to apply for a renewal will result in the deletion of all data and the space will become available for use by other users.

For more information on yearly project renewals, see the [Yearly Project Renewal user guide](/user-information/user-guides/research-computing-user-portal/yearly-project-renewal).
