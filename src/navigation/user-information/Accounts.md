All USC students, staff, and faculty have access to the Center for Advanced Research Computing's systems for their research projects. The CARC offers different types and sizes of computing and storage resource allocations for these projects.

### Access to CARC systems

In order to access the CARC's systems, you must either be the Principal Investigator (PI) of a research project or an authorized member of a PI's research project.

CARC systems are accessed using your USC NetID and password, so there is no additional requirement for CARC-specific account creation.

>Note: Your USC NetID is the first part of your USC email address (e.g., ttrojan@usc.edu's NetID is ttrojan).

Duo Two-Factor Authentication is also required. If you have not already signed up for Duo on your USC NetID account, please visit [this page](https://itservices.usc.edu/duo/enroll) to enroll.

Access to and use of resources is based on participation in projects. Project setup and resource allocation requests must be made by a project's PI using the [Research Computing User Portal](https://hpcaccount.usc.edu/). Detailed instructions for project and resource management are available in the [Research Computing User Portal user guides](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/research-computing-user-portal).

### Principal Investigator (PI) eligibility

PhD-level researchers, which include faculty, research staff, and postdocs, are eligible for PI status, which is required for project creation and allocation requests. If you're eligible for PI status, the Research Computing User Portal will recognize this when you log in and you will automatically be granted PI permissions (account creation, resource requests, adding users to a project, etc.).

If you believe you're eligible for PI status but this isn't reflected in the Research Computing User Portal, please [submit a help ticket](/user-information/ticket-submission) to the CARC.

### Computing resource allocations

The CARC offers two types of computing resource allocations: class and research. For both resources, the unit of SU (System Unit) is used. One SU indicates one hour's use of a single CPU core.

#### Class allocations

The class allocation supports academic classes with limited size and timeline. It supports up to 10,000 SUs and expires at the end of a semester. Faculty who need a class allocation should request this resource in the Research Computing User Portal at least two weeks before the beginning of the semester.

#### Research allocations

The research allocation has three size tiers depending on the computational needs of the associated projects. The allocation usually starts in the new fiscal year, and it must be renewed annually at the end of each fiscal year to continue the use of the allocation. Requests for new research allocations and renewals must be submitted 30 days prior to the start of the allocation period/new fiscal year.

The table below shows a summary of the computing allocation tiers and their sizes.

| Allocation Type | Size (in SUs)       |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Small           | 200,000         |
| Medium          | 500,000         |
| Large           | 1,000,000       |

#### Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) allocations

For GPUs, the charge per SU varies depending on the GPU model. The table below shows the SU charge for different GPU models.

| GPU Model | System Unit (SU) Charge |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| K20, K40  | 2                       |
| K80       | 4                       |
| P100      | 6                       |
| V100      | 8                       |

### Storage resource allocations

Storage allocations are measured using disk space in terabytes (equivalent to 1,000 gigabytes).  

All users of active projects automatically receive a storage allocation on the CARC project file system. The default allocation size is 1 TB per PI, which can be increased up to 5 TB per PI, if needed, at no extra cost. If a PI has multiple projects, the maximum allocation of 5 TB can be divided among the projects.

If more than 5 TB is needed, a PI can request additional storage space through the Research Computing User Portal. The additional storage space in excess of the first 5 TB is a paid service. The current price is $40/TB/year. For example, when a PI requires 10 TB of space, the annual charge for the data storage space will be:

>10 TB per year = 5 TB free + (5 x $40/TB/year = $200/year)

### Yearly renewal of allocations

The duration of computing and storage resource allocations is  one year. Each year, PIs must renew their projects and associated allocations in the Research Computing User Portal. Changes to allocation sizes or types can be made during this renewal. Failure to apply for a renewal will result in the deletion of all data and the space will become available for use by other users.

For more information on yearly project renewals, see the [Yearly Project Renewal user guide](/user-information/user-guides/high-performance-computing/research-computing-user-portal/yearly-project-renewal).
