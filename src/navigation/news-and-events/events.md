excerpt: Monthly CARC events and registration instructions.
---

Throughout the year, the Center for Advanced Research Computing hosts numerous events with the goal of educating the USC community on research computing topics.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CARC and most USC departments are currently working remotely. As such, all CARC events will take place virtually (e.g., via Zoom) for the foreseeable future.

## Upcoming events

At this time, the only scheduled events the CARC is hosting are weekly research computing workshops. Each workshop is approximately two hours long and is hosted over Zoom.

**Workshop: Software Modules on Discovery (NEW!)**  

*Friday, September 18, 2020  
1:00-2:50 pm*  

This workshop introduces CARC users to Discovery's software module system using Lmod, a Lua-based module system. Users will learn how to manage their environment, find software, and load modules. This workshop is recommended for new users and for experienced CARC users who may not be familiar with a module system.

**Workshop: CP2K: Running Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations**  

*Recurring on Mondays (September 7, 14, 21, and 28)  
12:00-2:00 pm*

An introduction to computational tools implemented within the CP2K program package. The most standard methods as well as some of the more advanced features will be introduced by overviews of background theory and through examples of application, while encouraging modular, flexible, and problem-oriented thinking. Recurring topics in the workshop are the scaling of algorithms, the combination of different levels of theory and of sampling, and tools and strategies for the analysis of results.
