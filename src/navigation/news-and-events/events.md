Throughout the year, the Center for Advanced Research Computing hosts numerous events with the goal of educating the USC community on research computing topics.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CARC and most USC departments are currently working remotely. As such, all CARC events will take place virtually (e.g., via Zoom) for the foreseeable future.

## Upcoming events

At this time, the only scheduled events the CARC is hosting are its weekly workshops. Each workshop is approximately two hours long and is hosted over Zoom.
