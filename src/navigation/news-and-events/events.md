Throughout the year, the Center for Advanced Research Computing hosts numerous events with the goal of educating the USC community on research computing topics.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CARC and most USC departments are currently working remotely. As such, all CARC events will take place virtually (e.g., via Zoom) for the foreseeable future.

## Upcoming events

At this time, the only scheduled events the CARC is hosting are its weekly workshops. Each workshop is approximately two hours long and is hosted over Zoom.

**Workshop: CP2K: Running Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Simulations**  

*Friday, August 21, 2020  
1:00-2:50 pm*

An introduction to computational tools implemented within the CP2K program package. The most standard methods as well as some of the more advanced features will be introduced by overviews of background theory and through examples of application, while encouraging modular, flexible, and problem-oriented thinking. Recurring topics in the workshop are the scaling of algorithms, the combination of different levels of theory and of sampling, and tools and strategies for the analysis of results.
