excerpt: Monthly CARC events and registration instructions.
---

Throughout the year, the Center for Advanced Research Computing hosts numerous events with the goal of educating the USC community on research computing topics.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the CARC and most USC departments are currently working remotely. As such, all CARC events will take place virtually (e.g., via Zoom) for the foreseeable future.

At this time, the only scheduled events the CARC is hosting are weekly research computing workshops. Each workshop is approximately two hours long and is hosted over Zoom.

For additional workshops and training related to research, see USC's Office of Research's [calendar of events](https://research.usc.edu/events/).
