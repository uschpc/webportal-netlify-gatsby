The primary mission of the Center for Advanced Research Computing is to support USC researchers in their work. The CARC strives to provide an excellent user experience, both on an ad hoc basis and through ongoing partnerships with research teams.

In 2014, the CARC (then called the Center for High-Performance Computing) was the recipient of a National Science Foundation grant (#1341935) to support the development of a high-performance computing facilitation program. Today, the CARC employs three full-time Research Facilitators to provide support to the USC research community.

The CARC's Research Facilitation & Applications team enables research computing through education, outreach, and training. Our Research Facilitators offer regular onboarding sessions and office hours at USCâ€™s University Park and Health Sciences campuses, introductory and advanced training workshops, and in-person and remote consultations. Individual support requests are handled through a user ticketing system.

In addition to standard user support, the CARC offers a more in-depth, collaborative experience for researchers with specific and diverse needs. This type of specialized partnership is aimed at research teams that require customized support for their projects, including data management, workflow development, and software installation. Through this service, CARC staff function as consultants to researchers, offering their expertise in computational science.
