The Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC) offers consulting to help faculty and other campus researchers obtain access to and effectively use cloud computing resources through our relationship with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a preferred vendor. The CARC will be adding support for Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud Platform in the near future.

The CARC can help:

* Determine if the cloud is a good fit to meet your research requirements.
* Plan for and manage costs of custom cloud solutions.
* Gain access to cloud computing resources, both for research and research-related instruction.

### Amazon Web Services

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) is USC's preferred and recommended cloud provider. AWS provides a broad set of infrastructure services, such as computing power, storage options, networking, and databases, all delivered as a utility: on-demand, available in minutes, with pay-as-you-go pricing.  All of these resources are maintained in secure data centers in multiple geographic locations.

The CARC works closely with public cloud vendors to provide research teams with cost-effective cloud access and meet federal compliance regulations (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA).

### Does your research belong in the cloud?

If your current research computing environment is costing you time, straining your budget, or giving you headaches, you may want to consider cloud computing, which offers a versatile and powerful platform for research computing. The CARC can help you understand the costs and benefits of the cloud.

### Moving your research to the cloud

The CARC can consult with you to help you understand what is involved in moving your research computing to the cloud. While cloud computing is relatively new, it has quickly become recognized as an empowering technology that is being widely adopted across many research domains.

If you are interested in the cloud or not fully satisfied with your current computing solution, the CARC can help you build a model of how a cloud implementation would work for your research, and what it will cost you in time and money.
