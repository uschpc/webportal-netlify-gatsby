The primary mission of the Advanced Research Computing Center will always be to support USC researchers in their work. To that end, the ARCC offers assistance to researchers who are seeking funding in the form of external grants from research centers and federal agencies, such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The ARCC enables researchers to perform the advanced, innovative computational research necessary to remain competitive in the academic world. Use of high-performance computing resources can elevate research possibilities to a level that's unreachable with the resources of a personal computer.

In addition to providing computing resources, the ARCC can directly assist researchers with the grant proposal process. *how?*
