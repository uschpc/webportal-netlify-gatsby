excerpt: Information on the CARC's Condo Cluster Program (CCP).
---

In an effort to provide the most comprehensive support to the USC research community, the Center for Advanced Research Computing offers researchers a way to customize their high-performance computing experience.

The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. The CCP operates on both direct purchase and annual subscription-based models. All hardware is purchased and maintained by the CARC throughout the course of the lease or subscription term.

The CARC is currently developing the policies for the new Condo Cluster Program. Later in 2020, information on the new Condo Cluster Program, including available resources, pricing, and the enrollment process, will be made available in the [Condo Cluster Program pages](/user-information/ccp). If you're interested in learning more about subscribing to condo nodes in the meantime, please contact us at <carc-condo@usc.edu>.
