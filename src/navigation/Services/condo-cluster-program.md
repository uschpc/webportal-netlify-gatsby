In an effort to provide the most comprehensive support to the USC research community, the Center for Advanced Research Computing offers researchers a way to customize their experience with the Discovery cluster.

The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. The CCP operates on an annual subscription-based model, with research groups subscribing to their selected number of compute and storage resources on a yearly basis. All of the hardware is purchased and maintained by the CARC throughout the course of the subscription term.

The resources that a researcher subscribes to will be dedicated for use by their condo queue. Researchers also have the option to participate in a shared "Community Queue" of nodes. The Community Queue grants them access to idle nodes in other researchers' condo queues, giving them the flexibility to run larger jobs without having to invest in more dedicated resources.

The CARC is currently developing the policies for the new Condo Cluster Program. Later in 2020, information on the new Condo Cluster Program, including available resources, pricing, and the enrollment process, will be made available in the [Condo Cluster Program user guides](/user-information/user-guides/condo-cluster-program).
