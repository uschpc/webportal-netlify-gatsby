excerpt: Information on the CARC's Condo Cluster Program (CCP).
---

In an effort to provide the most comprehensive support to the USC research community, the Center for Advanced Research Computing offers researchers a way to customize their high-performance computing experience.

The Condo Cluster Program (CCP) is a service available to USC researchers that require dedicated resources for their work. The CCP gives researchers the convenience of having their own dedicated compute nodes, without the responsibility of purchasing and maintaining the nodes themselves. The CCP operates on two different models - an annual subscription model and a traditional system purchase model - to provide researchers with flexible and efficient options for their resources. All hardware is purchased and maintained by the CARC throughout the course of the lease or subscription term.

For more information on the CCP, including details on the two purchase models and pricing, see the [Condo Cluster Program pages](/user-information/ccp).
