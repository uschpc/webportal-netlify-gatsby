As the amount of data used in computational research continues to grow, so too does the need for computing solutions that can manage large data sets. The Advanced Research Computing Center offers solutions for researchers that have more data than they can manage on a personal computer.

The ARCC's new high-performance computing cluster, Discovery, was designed with big data in mind. Discovery includes a rapidly growing fleet of state-of-the art multicore compute nodes for data-intensive research jobs, backed by an 800 Terabyte, high-throughput scratch filesystem. A low-latency, high-bandwidth InfiniBand network fabric facilitates intense research workloads on large data sets. Nearly 100 Gigabytes of storage space is provided for each user to store important code and configuration files in their home directories. For those researchers who might require more storage space, the ARCC can increase quotas on Discovery to accommodate larger data sets.

Rather than using a third-party service, researchers can securely manage their data directly on Discovery. The ARCC can help researchers develop an effective data management workflow for their projects. what else???

The ARCC also has the ability to support the secure storage and management of sensitive data. short sentence summarizing our secure computing platform. For more information, see our Secure Computing page.
