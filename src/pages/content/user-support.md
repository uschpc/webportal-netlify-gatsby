**Office hours**: Office hours are an opportunity for CARC users to ask questions about anything CARC-related. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom **every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm**. Office hours are drop-in and do not require registration, but you will need a USC NetID to join the Zoom meeting.

For more information, see the [Office Hours and Consultations page](/education-and-outreach/office-hours).
