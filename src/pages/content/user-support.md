**Office Hours**: Office hours are an opportunity for CARC users to ask questions about anything CARC-related. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

**Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm.** Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all CARC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email hpc-support@usc.edu for assistance.

**Consultations**: Consultations for CARC account holders are available outside of regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:

-New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the CARC's services.

-CARC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting.

-Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.

If you'd like to request a consultation, please fill out a [consultation request](https://usc.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cYiW9xq8lug7yjb). Currently, all consultations are taking place via Zoom.
