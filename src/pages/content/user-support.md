**Office Hours**: Office hours are an opportunity for ARCC users to ask questions about anything ARCC-related. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

**Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm**. Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all ARCC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email hpc@usc.edu for assistance.

**Consultations**: Consultations for ARCC account holders are available outside of  regularly scheduled office hours. These are recommended for:

 - New condo owners, research groups, and instructors who wish to explore the ARCC's services.
 - ARCC users who have a complex and/or time-critical problem that is best resolved with a (virtual) face-to-face meeting.
 - Users who cannot attend the regularly scheduled office hours.

Please fill out a consultation request to speak with a research computing facilitator. Currently, all consultations are taking place via Zoom.
