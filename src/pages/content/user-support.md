**Office Hours**: Office hours are an opportunity for CARC users to ask questions about anything CARC-related. No appointments are necessary, and all levels of users and questions are welcomed. Office hours are typically held weekly at the University Park campus (UPC) and twice a month at the Health Sciences campus (HSC).

**Currently, all office hours are taking place via Zoom every Tuesday from 2:30-5:00 pm.** Zoom meeting information for office hours is included in the monthly activity calendar email that all CARC users receive. If you are unable to find this calendar, please email <carc-support@usc.edu> for assistance.

For more information, see the [Office Hours and Consultations page](/education-and-outreach/office-hours).
