In 2020, the CARC performed a major upgrade to its high-performance computing cluster.

### Computing Resources

The CARC computing resource consists of 2 shared head nodes and a total of 2,700 compute nodes. The typical compute node has 2 to 12 cores/dual-processor chip sets and reside on either a 10-gigabit Myrinet backbone or a 56.6-gigabit FDR Infiniband backbone.

### Operating System

The CARC uses a customized distribution of the Community Enterprise Operating System (CentOS), built using the publicly available RPM Package Manager (RPM), which is found on the USC mirror website and other mirrors around the world.  CentOS is a high-quality Linux distribution that gives the CARC complete control of its open-source software packages and is fully customized to suit advanced research computing needs, without the need for license fees.

The CARCâ€™s distribution of CentOS was modified for minor bug fixes and desired localized behavior. Many desktop and clustering-related packages were also added to our CentOS installation.

A number of white papers, tutorials, FAQs and other documentation on CentOS can be found on the [official CentOS website](https://www.centos.org/).
