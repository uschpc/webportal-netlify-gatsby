Professor Andrew (Andy) McMahon is the Chair of the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Director of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California (USC). McMahon joined USC from Harvard University in 2012 as the W.M. Keck Provost Professor of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, and Biological Sciences, and founding chair of the Department of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.

McMahon is a leader in the field of developmental biology. McMahon’s research has provided fundamental insights into the cell interactions driving assembly of multiple organ systems, including the central nervous system, skeleton and kidney. McMahon’s research has identified diverse mechanisms regulating organ development, tissue repair and cancer. Current research focuses on development, injury and repair of the mammalian kidney, to model and treat kidney disease.

McMahon received his bachelor’s degree from Oxford University and his PhD from University College London. McMahon completed his postdoctoral research at the California Institute of Technology, then moved to London to start his independent research laboratory in 1984. In 1988, McMahon took up a position as assistant member at the Roche Institute for Molecular Biology, becoming full member and chair of the department in 1992. In 1993, McMahon became a professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University. In a 19-year career at Harvard, McMahon was the Frank B. Baird Jr., Professor of Science, chair of the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, a founding faculty of the Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Biology, and principal investigator of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.

McMahon is an elected fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the European Molecular Biology Organization and the Royal Society.

Working with large data sets in the range of 10 to 30 gigabytes, McMahon’s lab employs HPC resources for bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing data, including experiments to monitor protein-DNA interactions using ChIP-seq, a sequencing method combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel sequencing.
