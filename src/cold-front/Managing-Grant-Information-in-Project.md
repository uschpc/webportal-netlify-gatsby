We encourage all faculty members to provide information about the grants they've received that provide a percent credit, direct funds to HPC, and/or were awarded based on use of HPC's resources.


Providing funds to HPC will allow us to boost your priority and jobs run by everyone in your group will start faster.  More details can be found on our website


### Adding grants to your project:


To enter grant information, click the green "Add Grant" button from the Project Description view.  



Fill in all fields pertaining to your grant (anything with an asterisk* is required) and click the blue "Save" button.  Descriptions of the fields are as follows:
* **Title** - enter the full title of the grant provided by the funding agency
* **Grant number from funding agency** - enter grant number provided by the funding agency.  If this grant is still pending, enter 0000
* **Role** - choose from PI, Co-PI, or SP (senior personnel)
* **Grant PI Full Name** - if you're not the PI, please enter the PI's full name.  We use this to ensure that we're not counting the same grant multiple times 
* **Funding agency** - select from list.  If it is not in the list, choose Other and enter the name in the next field
* **Other funding agency** - enter the agency's name if not found in the list
* **Other award number** - enter if there are several numbers given to the grant
* **Grant start date** - select from the calendar when the grant begins
* **Grant end date** - select from the calendar when the grant ends
* **Percent credit** - this is the number listed on the USC Sponsored Projects form for a grant submission as financial credit to the department/unit in the credit distribution section.  If you listed a percent of the grant to give to HPC, enter that here.  If not, enter 0
* **Direct funding** - funds budgeted specifically for HPC services, hardware, software, and/or personnel support.  If none, enter 0
* **Total amount awarded** - total amount you were awarded in the grant.  We use this to show how much HPC is supporting in research dollars.
* **Status** - choose from active, archived, or pending


Once created, you'll see the grant listed in the project description view:
